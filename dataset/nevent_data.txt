Again I apologize for the lack of updates over the past few days and will use this space to recap a weekend that was both good and bad
On Friday a small group of friends and I attended a most-righteous Sister Hazel concert at Floyd's Music Store for the third straight, and for the third straight year I was blown away by one of my favorite live bands
Sister Hazel has a way of becoming intimate with the fans by brining them into the show
It's something you can always expect from these guys, unlike so many other performers, and is why I never miss a show when they're in town
Naturally, I dressed up as Hugh Hefner and took the role of making sure everyone was having a good time
I have yet to hear any complaints from any of the guests
On Saturday the Seminoles were bested by unranked Maryland; effectively ending our chances at a national title this year
In addition, the quarterback controversy has once again debouched as Chris Rix almost took us to victory with his deep threat
Fortunately the agony of defeat was blanketed somewhat by our Halloween party and I won't have to worry about Seminole Football until next Saturday
On Sunday we saw Saw and as expected I was less than satisfied
It was neither better nor worse than last week's The Grudge but the trailers beforehand dictate that the end of this year and the beginning of 2005 will bring us a large quantity of horror movies
If I enjoy one out of five considering the genre I can say it's worth it
I wish I could have been at a Pub, or wherever these people convene, to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this morning (emphasis added)
The Home Office and police chiefs should instead tackle the possession of guns in criminal hands, said Prof Mauser, a member of the independent Fraser Institute in Canada
He has given evidence to select committees of the House of Commons and the Canadian Senate and predicted the escalation of gun crime on Britain's streets
I believe that factors of political correctness are at work, he said
Police crackdowns, Home Office initiatives and over-regulation of legally held weapons create froth and they may even fool the police themselves into believing they are doing something about gun crime
Recorded gun crime rose by three per cent to 10,590 incidents in the year to June 
Two-thirds of gun crime takes place in London, Birmingham and Manchester
It doesn't matter to these people that crime has skyrocketed since the irrational ban on private gun possession went into effect in Great Britain
Just as long as it's there, they feel safe
I can see why he would do it
He was probably running around being shot at for days on end in Falluja
There should be an investigation but they should look into the circumstances, said Lance Corporal Christopher Hanson
Two shots to the head, said Sergeant Nicholas Graham, 24, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
You can't trust these people
He should not be investigated
He did nothing wrong
I've got too many friends in Iraq right now I want to see come home alive and well, and I will support them at every opportunity
I didn't mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore the issue, but I have been extremely busy last week with Thanksgiving and everything that goes along with it
This is problem that needs to be addressed
As this article points out, the SKS wasn't included on the list of banned weapons as part of the 10-year ban on certain assault weapons signed by President Clinton
The SKS is a medium-powered carbine equipped with a 10-round magazine, just like the pistol I'm displaying in the photo on the left hand side of this blog
Banned weapons had capacities of more than 10 rounds; so like my small 9mm, the SKS was not classified as an assault weapon
So let's not center our discussion around the gun, let's talk about the person behind the trigger
Well, we'll debate that later on in the show
We'll have a couple of experts come out, so I'll withhold my comments until then
Now, why has our president placed homeland security in the hands of Republican political hacks instead of professionals, by the way
Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example, is a career politician
Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge is another career politician who was passed over by Mr. Bush for the vice presidency
And Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Asa Hutchinson is yet another career politician and a graduate of the disgraceful Bob Jones University
Apparently, Mr. Bush only turns to professionals when it's really important, like political consulting
And you know what, they did a hell of a job for our country
Our president has put homeland security in the hands of failed Republican hacks
So it's OK it's OK to have professional politicians at the Justice
Department and the Pentagon
Janet Reno was a career prosecutor
ust a minute, let me finish my sentence, please
No, the difference is Janet Reno was a career prosecutor
John Ashcroft wasn't half the woman that Janet Reno was
Another potential Democratic presidential candidate pondered whether to run, and he made his announcement, and surprise, surprise, the answer was no
Why not
Surely Chris Dodd is at least more credible than Carol Moseley-Braun or Dennis Kucinich
I guess that means harassing Tom Ridge, fighting tax cuts and obstructing President Bush's plans to reform judiciary. Some two years
God, I hope so
that's all I can say
I love Senator Dodd
He would have brought a lot to the race
He brings a lot to the Senate and to the debate
And I'm glad that he's going to be fighting those fights
Well, the Commerce Department reports today that consumer spending declined in January and that the manufacturing sector slowed in February
Meanwhile, the deficit now at $300 billion
Mr. Bush apparently is untroubled by this fiscal collapse
One of his aides tells the current issue of TIME, magazine, quote, even if it's $500 billion, so what
Of course, even a $500 billion deficit number doesn't count the $3 trillion Mr. Bush is robbing from the Social Security trust fund
You know, we should have known, every time George W. Bush gets in trouble, he borrows from a trust fund. It's been his whole life, you know
Let me give you two economic facts of like, which you should know, even if you won't recognize them
Number one, there is absolutely no relationship between the deficit and unemployment
They don't go together
And number two, there is no Social Security fund, Virginia
There just isn't one
Because Bush squandered it on his tax cuts
There never has been one
There has been one for 60 years
Welcome back
Bad move
But while he was here, he gave us a whole lot of information
Gave us a whole lot of information
Well, our president told us that information proves that the dictator had chemical weapons, which is true
But what we just learned this week from Newsweek magazine which got a hold of the debriefings, is that he also told us it was destroyed back in 1995
Why hasn't our president told us that
Why do we have to learn it from Newsweek
I don't believe that he believed it was all destroyed
Good point
But shouldn't our president have told us what the CIA told him
Why do we learn from Newsweek
Should he level with us
Bush isn't sitting in that White House not thinking about the body bags coming home with great young men
I was at the medal of honor ceremony for the kids
I am shook over the aftermath
But, this guy is a monster, a mini-me Hitler
Take a look at it
That's pretty good support isn't it
Now, Bob, come on you don't really buy this
I mean, listen, this is the oldest trick in the book
You can have a general question like this that could mean anything and ask people and they give you what comes off the top of their head
But, ask them another question, ask them what they think about spending $1.3 trillion in destroying this economy
Ask them how they feel about getting bogged down
Well, I've seen some of the figures
Once you start telling Americans the story, the administration refuse today tell us story
Tom, you know what liberals want
They don't want a smoking gun, they want a smoking city
The Clinton people all say
Former Congressman, Bob Dornan from California
You're not going to get a smoking city
Time for Fireback, when the viewers fire back at us
Joshua Hosford of Newport Beach, California that would be nice in this weathers Paul, I guess we're going after all
Case in point, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed
It's amazing how someone can actually do two things at once
Joshua, you couldn't have said anything better
In fact, I've already said it
Well, in fact, our allies got Mr. Mohammed along with us
We need allies
And Bush is so far angered every ally we have
Bush has been torturing Americans for two years. Why should this guy get preferential treatment
And I thought he was I thought he was busy running the Redskins
No
OK
The next comment is from Frank Mastro of New York City
Mr.Novak, I don't understand the problem
I say that to all the rich millionaire Democrats, like Carville and Begala, who don't want tax cuts
Pay it anyway
They'll defeat Bush and everybody will get rich
That's a better strategy
David Horn of Long Island, New York, writes, How can Bush say he's for democracy
Where did he learn to govern, 1930's Chicago
Hi
I'm Paul Avalar from Tempe, Arizona
I had a question also about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed
That's a great question
It's an unanswerable point
He hasn't been able to answer it
And Tom Andrews wasn't able to answer it
Look, we need allies to catch these guys
We got him because the Pakistanis got him
We didn't get him
It becomes impossible for those governments to cooperate with us like they're cooperating now
You know the one thing the Democrats can't stand is good news
It is just something you cannot handle
No
From the left, I'm Paul Begala
Good night for CROSSFIRE
From the right, I'm Robert Novak
Join us again next time for another edition of CROSSFIRE
Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
Ironically down in North Carolina today was also the day funeral services were held for 17-year-old Jesica Santillan, the brave young woman who got the wrong heart and lungs in a botched transplant operation last month
Is her family's pain and suffering only worth $250,000
Ralph Nader, there are states in crisis that keep adding to the list by the AMA where doctors are going out of business because they can't afford the medical malpractice rates
We'll just run a scroll of some of the states
They're big states. Florida, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Texas
This is a real crisis that lawyers have perpetrated on America, isn't it
Another one of your leading questions
This is a medical malpractice crisis
And the insurance companies which had relatively steady rates on doctors for about 10 years have found its investment income, its interest income, the stock market collapse down
And so they're jacking up the rates on a few key specialties like obstetricians and neurosurgeons
But if you take the entire amount of premiums, Bob, that's paid by doctrs in this country to malpractice insurers and divide it evenly, they'd be paying less than $9,000 each
That's one-third of what they pay a receptionist
You know, Ralph, you and I often agree on some things and one thing I think we agree on is the dirty effect of money and politics
This is first and foremost, Bob, a question of equity
The Congress is going to handcuff the judges and juries in the United States at the state court level
I haven't yet met one senator or representative who's for this bill who has demonstrated that the jurors in their home state and the judges in their home state are incompetent, unwilling or unable to perform justice in these medical malpractice cases
And I've never heard one person say that the insurance executives who make $250,000 a week, every week without any pain and suffering, no one is saying cap those
Dr. Palmisano, first thank you for being here
Thank you
Pleasure to be here
And, I want to ask you to respond to one of the witnesses, John McCormick testified today
He said that the hospital ignored abnormal CO2 levels in her blood
Said that the attending physician had slept through several pages
Listen to what Mr. McCormick said and I'll ask you to respond
Mr. President, from father to father, my family's pain and suffering are not frivolous
Isn't he right
Isn't our president wrong to be did he win the Lottery
You know, Mr. Bush President Bush says these guys have won the litigation Lottery
Well, the current medical liability system is affecting patients in that they can't get access to care
The American Medical Association works very hard to make safety a priority in the medical care system
The current system doesn't measure negligence
It measures disability
Another witness today told of what happened to her husband because there were no longer neurosurgeons available in the community
Those are important points, I don't doubt
Yes
Well, what has to be done here is balance
What we need is a system that's fair to everyone, a system that keeps the physicians in practice and allows patients to have access to physicians in their hour of need.
And the system in California that's in the bill, in Congress now, HR-5, that's a system that has worked
Because in California they have regulated the insurance company premium levels
And in Florida, they've been very weak on it
In other words a small percentage of doctors that are bad, incompetent, indifferent, whatever
They're not performing properly and the AMA is not cracking down, is not supporting expansion to state licensing
I want to respond to that
The National Practitioner Data Bank is the source of the information and it was brought up today
First of all, the Government Accounting Office criticized the methodology used
It doesn't mention whether they are obstetricians, neurosurgeons or emergency medicine
It doesn't list that
Now are these bad doctors
We'll have no doctors, we'll have no neurosurgeons, no obstetricians
We've got to take a break
Maybe they are bad doctors
Welcome back
Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country
President Bush points this way today, even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money, premiums go up and either way, the patient pays
We're debating malpractice reform with consumer advocate Ralph Nader, and AMA President-Elect Dr. Ronald Palmisano
Dr Palmisano, again, thanks for staying with us through the break
He was the governor of my state of Texas, where there are a whole lot of doctors
It turns out that he didn't do any ind of a job policing your profession at all when he was the governor of Texas
It has forgiven physicians who overlook cancerous tumors, who maimed infants or whose mistakes left women sterilized
Thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade
That is the Bush record in policing surgeons, why should we trust him now
Well, first off
Physicians generally, not just surgeons, forgive me
Sure
What we need to do is to make sure that state boards, number one, have adequate funding
The AMA supports that
But it's also
Well, it's also unfair to make a judgment without knowing all of the facts of the case
Troy Brennan of Harvard said there's no correlation with negligence, only with disability
So let's look at all of the facts, but give everybody due process here in America before we criticize
Even file a claim
And the entire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money, not the 90 percent who never file a claim, amounts to less than what we spend on dog food
On dog food
It's about $5.4 billion is the pay-out
That's a fraction of physician income
It's a fraction of the health care expense of 1.4 trillion
What we have to do is look at all the facts and have balance here
That's what the people in Congress have to do
They have to make sure that whatever they decide keeps doctors in practice and patients having access to care
Doctors are going
They don't abandon their patients, except for the high premiums of a few specialties
Because of the premiums
But first of all let me
Why don't you crack down on the insurance companies
No. Let's talk about the facts
Let's talk about the facts
That's the fact
I was just in Oklahoma, they own this insurance company
They are trying to do their very best
It's a company not for profit
What happens here is that more money is being paid out than comes in
And as far as the investment income, A.M
Bests show that in the past five years, the investment income has been stable at around 5 percent
Brown Brothers Harriman said that investments did not precipitate the current crisis
Why do you want that to be secret
All of the information about bad doctors in the National Practitioner bank, you, the AMA wants to keep it secret from other doctors and other patients around the country who want to know whether their doctor is on that list
Let's listen to what he said to the AMA today
They should be able to recover non- economic damages as well
But for the sake of the system, non- economic damages should be capped at $250,000
What in the world is wrong with that
Tell me what's wrong with that
What's wrong
Tell someone who had a double mastectomy, tell an infant who's brain-damaged and has no economic loss that for the rest of their lives they're going to get dribbled out $250,000 for their entire life expectancy
Wait a minute
The head of AIG a few years ago was making $250,000 every week
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money, though
Not for you, but for most people it's a lot of money
These executives, why don't you tell
In California - wait, Mr. Nader. In California
Why don't you cap insurance
Mr. Palmisano, go ahead
Give me a moment, please
Go ahead, go ahead
In California where they have this law, it caps the non-economics, the ones you can't quantify
So all medicals, all rehabilitation, care services in the home, lost wages
No, no, no
I've got to ask Mr. Nader, we are almost out of time
Doug Friedman, who ran Jesse Ventura's campaign for governor four years ago, says he wants you to run for president again
I know you're saying it's much too early to run for president
But one simple question, Ralph, will you consider another run for president
Much too early to consider
I am concerned about Donald Zook, who's head of a medical malpractice insurance company, a big one in the West, saying that his insurance company executive colleagues should not blame the tort injury system
He said that your problem of jacking up these insurance rates is self-inflicted
Here's an insurance company executive who is saying that
Well, Mr. Zook is one executive you are quoting
What we need to do is look at all of the people who don't have doctors
Hey, let's get some agreement
Should we get some agreement
What
Do you want to really crack down on the bad doctors
We want to crack down on the attorneys who file frivolous suits
Fine. Fine
What kind of peer review is that
Wait. Wait
Do you want to crack down on the bad doctors
You're in AMA
We definitely want to crack down on bad doctors
Do you want to control insurance rates
We want the free market to dictate what is done
The free market actually dictates we have got to sell some commercials here on CNN or we're all out of
Thanks. Privilege to be here
Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
Over in Iraq, arms inspectors are discovering and destroying missiles
Spy planes are searching for more banned arms, and Iraqi scientists are being interviewed by U.N. weapons inspectors
Back with us to talk about it, two Congressmen: J.D
Hayworth, the Republican from Arizona, and Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont
But I want to ask you a question
The answer is, these are my neighbors from Vermont and obviously we're going to support them
But let's be clear
The president almost unilaterally is putting us in this position against world opinion
Didn't the Congress support it
I thought you voted for it
I did not vote for it
I mean the Congress
The majority rules
The Congress gave him authority, but the American people disagreed with the decision
Not according to the polls
Not the polls that I have seen
Congressman Hayworth, back to a comment
And I know that you meant it and I agreed with it
This is Saddam Hussein, the butcher of Baghdad
I'm curious, would that have accurately described him in 1988
Oh, yes. I think it does
I think it has described him, especially since he's taken basically a one-man rule over with the Baath Party in 1979
I agree
Therefore, wasn't Dick Cheney, as the CEO of Halliburton, wrong to be selling oilfield equipment to the butcher of Baghdad in 1988
I don't know about any oil equipment going to Saddam Hussein
What I do know in the here and now is
I can tell you about it if you like
That's fine
And I know you'd love to cloud the issue
That's an important issue to me
Dissent is fine, but these cheap shots, I don't know anything about Halliburton.
He had $73 million worth of to sell oilfield equipment to Saddam Hussei
And to somehow try to play partisan parlor games may be cute, but we are dealing with a clear and present danger
Would you have treated him as a customer, the way Dick Cheney did
I don't even know about that
Would you have sold oilfield equipment to him
Yes. Hello
Iran had hostages
Seventy-nine Americans were held hostage
Hello
We're talking
The United States of America
Oh the evil United States
But the point is
I want to get to that point
I can't quite figure that out
Everybody knows that
The CIA did that
No, the point I made, Khomeini came about because we put a brutal dictator, the Shah of Iran, in power
The point that I am making is you cannot
The point you're making is blame America first\
No I'm not
That's what you're doing
You're talking about blowback
We know what happens
Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, thank you very much
Congressman J.D. Hayworth, a Republican from Arizona, thank you both very much
We will come back to this debate, believe me
One of our viewers, though, thinks there's a sure fire way to get that al Qaeda ring leader to talk
We'll let him fire back in a little bit
But next, out of all of the pictures from this weekend's nail biter between J.D. Hayworth's alma mater of state, and
Bob Novak's beloved University of Maryland, only one photo is dramatic enough or politically charged enough to be the CROSSFIRE Picture of the Day
You do not want to miss this
Hi. I'm Christa Demore from Monrovia, Maryland
And it also proves you can even chew gum and walk at the same time
Doesn't it show that
He cannot eat a pretzel and watch a football became at the same time
So I'm still doubtful of no, here's why
This is a serious point and you deserve a serious answer
We now have a foreign policy in Iraq that is putting enormous strain on those allies
We're not severing it question
Hi. I'm Ben Charlton from East Lansing, Michigan
I was if we wait for U.N. approval for action in Iraq, don't we sacrifice some of our national sovereignty
Well, where are all of the conservative questions
We never have conservatives in the audience
There's no question
I think even Paul would agree with me
It's not a United Nations question
That is correct
The president has got all of the legal authorities he needs
I just pray to god he doesn't use it
We need to go to the U.N. because we want to build coalitions so we have support around the world and so that we don't have to carry the burden ourselves
But legally he has no obligation to go back to the U.N
From the left I am Paul Begala
Goodnight for CROSSFIRE
From the right, I'm Robert Novak
Join us next time for another edition of CROSSFIRE
Hello, everybody
Welcome to CROSSFIRE
We will debate all of that as well as Vanity Fair's latest, stunning revelations about Michael Jackson
Believe it or not, we got new news on Michael Jackson
Do you think he really looks like a mummy
Certainly not a daddy
But first, our own little moonwalk across the political landscape, the CROSSFIRE Political Alert
The foreign ministers of France, Germany and Russia today issued a joint declaration that they will not allow a second American-backed resolution to pass the United Nations Security Council
President Bush is said to be focusing on one fence-sitting Security Council member, the African nation of Guinea, because he said quote I used to have one of their pigs
So OK, I made that up
He didn't say that
Well, I suspected that
You know
But they are a swing vote
Guinea is an important swing vote
As is Cameroon
France and Germany are pointing to inspection and saying, Look, they're working
I think that's a good point
Well, France and Germany would like to
Powell called Iraqi steps toward disarmament quote too little, too late gestures, meant to split international resolve to force Baghdad to give up its weapons of mass destruction
U.S. intelligence said Powell indicates Iraq has hidden equipment to produce al-Samoud 2 missiles, even as it destroys existing ones, missiles that until recently, it claimed not to have
Powell also revealed that Iraq is hiding chemical and biological weapons in poor neighborhoods around Baghdad
In order to secure peace, Powell concluded, the international community must confront Saddam Hussein's refusal to disarm quote here and now
So, there you have it
who do you believe
Secretary of State Colin Powell or France
No, the question is
That is the question
Who do you believe: the Bush administration or your lying eyes
We are watching them destroy weapons, as the president says, Oh, that's just a hoax
But Paul
They are disarming
No, no, no that's not what the president's saying
He's saying, the it's a hoax to the extent that those are only a small number of the weapons there
Keep in mind, these are weapons that Saddam Hussein, until recently, said he didn't even have
He's a liar
Of course
And to trust Saddam Hussein in effort to disarm him foolish task,don't you think
Absolutely. Nobody trusts Saddam Hussein. 
The question is, Is he a sufficient threat to America today to risk the lives of our young men and women
That's a separate question
That's a very separate question
I think he's not
I think the inspections can work
That's a different argument
We can take it up later
So there it is, according to NBC
In fact, the only liberal with the solo cable talk show
NBC, of course, is a division of the conglomerate GE, where they apparently only bring right wing things to life
I actually like Phil Donahue
I've interviewed him a number of times
His arguments are really dumb
I don't know if you've listened to Phil Donahue
Delightful guy, but his arguments don't make a lot of sense and I think that is the problem with liberal talk show hosts you excluded, of course, and James
But the arguments, actually, don't hold up very well
Have you noticed that
He had the highest-rated show on the network
Which is saying what
They're good to me
They're very nice people and they're very good to me
OK, OK, I'm not beat up on MSNBC
Early reviews have not been good, so yesterday she announced she'll be making some changes
Not to her ideas, which are few
Not to her record, which is pretty embarrassing
Not even to her staff, which is, of course, tiny
But to her name
From here on out, Carol Moseley-Braun as Carol Moseley Braun
Did you catch the difference
In the second version, there is no hyphen between her last names
Moseley Braun expects that primary voters in Iowa and New Hampshire will react enthusiastically to this radical, grammatical transformation
They'll have to, because the latest CNN poll shows Moseley Braun far behind the candidate she set out to discredit
That would be, of course, the honorable Al Sharpton
Sharpton is not only by far the first choice of black voters nationally, he is tied with Senator John Edwards among all voters and beating Governor Howard Dean, Representative Dennis Kucinich and Senator Bob Graham
Beating them
And Al Sharpton didn't even have to change his name
How did he become honorable
Yes
By embodying the values of your party
Your values, not mine
He's the No. 1 pick, the most popular, among all candidates, among black primary voters
I mean, you can't dismiss him. He's a serious candidate
We haven't even begun the primaries
He's not a serious candidate
He's right wing fantasy and it's never going to happen
Not right wing
Take Al Sharpton seriously, that's our message tonight
Then, can you spell prosthetic nose
Maureen Orth can, and she does in a new Vanity Fair profile of Michael Jackson
We'll talk to her
You won't want to miss that
We'll be right back
Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
France, Russia and Germany today restated their opposition to any new U.N. Security Council that could threaten Saddam Hussein's grip on power
Secretary of State Colin Powell goes to the U.N. tomorrow to do what he can
Mr.King, thanks for stying with us through the break
And you're a congressman who has put his constituents and his country ahead of his partisan interests
So I wonder if you'll join Charlie Rangel, who put out a press release today, decrying the Republican attempt to hijack a bill to help our servicemen to use it to give special interest tax breaks to corporations
The important thing is that the bill pass for the military
If the other stuff's in there, it's there
I mean to me, the main purpose should be the military
I'm not going to disagree with Charlie's point
On the other hand, often when bills are passed, there are things attached to them
So to me, the key thing is that we ought to be taking care of the military and that's what we should do
A lot of Democrats said similar things
This weekend Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the No. 2 member of al Qaeda and another significant al Qaeda member were captured in Rawalpindi, Pakistan
Doesn't it turn out that Mr.Daschle and others didn't know what they were talking about and maybe they shouldn't make charges like that in public when they don't know what they were talking about
You would agree with that, wouldn't you
Why was he No. 3
Why wasn't he No. 4
Well, I don't know
I think that puts you pretty high up in the organization
I haven't the slightest clue who this guy was
I haven't heard anybody suggest that he's not one of the central figures in al Qaeda
Have you
But I think the main thing that we have now is we should concentrate on Osama bin Laden, we should concentrate on dismantling Saddam Hussein
A defenseless nation
They have biological weapons
How are they defenseless
Listen, if this is
It was our fault that they have biological and chemical weapons
Come on
Let me tell you
We have a lot of people
that have dangerous weapons
What happens if the North Koreans take another look
Our country is great enough and strong enough to maintain the moral authority to convince the international community that we're right
I'm sorry to have to do this, but we are out of time
I want have Congressman Peter King from New York back on, and Congressman Charlie Rangel
Thank you both for a very interesting debate
In a minute we will look at His Holiness, John Paul II's efforts to be a peacemaker
Later, the author of Vanity Fair's scary new look at the King of Pop, Michael Jackson
You will not want to miss this
Stay with us
Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
Maybe it's just me, but I think Michael Jackson, he's kooky, wacky
I recall, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, that the transactions were legal
Is it possible that the equipment allowed Iraq to produce oil for the Oil for Food program authorized by the U.N.
They were legal because Mr.Cheney's company used a loophole
They went through a foreign subsidiary
But they did enrich Saddam Hussein and his evil, ruthless regime, and they were immoral
They were wrong
Dick Cheney should have never profited off of doing business with Saddam Hussein
I would agree with that
It means Cheney is a hypocrite
Well it's a complete
That's great
Well yesterday he was a valued customer, today he's an even villain
Right. So we're against Dick Cheney, but that doesn't have anything to do with Saddam Hussein
It must be the humanitarian reasons
Well, Chad, that's what liberals assume
It is a weird assumption, don't you think
As you know, I've never said that
You haven't
It's called democracy
Those leaders are reflecting the views of their people
They hate America, Paul
My name is Christina Wright
I'm from Minneapolis, Minnesota
It might
I mean that's absolutely one of the fears
That it would destabilize the entire region
So the question is, could it be worse
Our president believes it will set off a positive domino effect of democracy through the region
Maybe he's right
I don't think he's thought it through
I think it's more likely that this very unstable region could cause even more problem
Oh, come on
That's silly
Hi. I'm Fabian from Bonn, Germany
It's actually Western Europe, because 18 European countries are on the side of the United States. So France and Germany that's actually true find themselves in the minority on their own continent
And good
Only Great Britain is with us
The only country
What do you mean only Great Britain
My question is not who votes at the U.N.
Nobody except Great Britain
We are isolated
From the left, I am Paul Begala
Goodnight for CROSSFIRE
From the right, I'm Tucker Carlson
Join us again tomorrow night for yet more CROSSFIRE
Their military service goes back to the Vietnam era
Others, though, are novices
They are, we are told, well trained
This is a messy business
In the spring of 1970, a squad of U.S. soldiers spotted a small unit of Viet Cong that had been circling for days
And what's that like
That's one of those introspective times where it's just it's just an introspective time, not a public time
After his first, he returned to a ship deck full of sailors and crew cheering, shaking his hand, pushing in to slap his back
And one of the guys looked at me and says
And, all of a sudden, bang, it just hit me
You don't think about those things
And it's removed
It's far off
It's not in close
Of all the wounds time does not heal, the ones that fester deep in the soul are the wounds you inflict
It's not something that civilized people do
You don't it's just not it's not a matter of being tormented, but troubled in the sense that that's not what we do, unless we're called upon to do it, under the most extreme set of circumstance
Training bridges that gap
So your choices are not varied
It's very simple
And so you do what you're trained to do
You do what you're there to do
And, in Vietnam, it was body count
It's hard to explain what training can do
Training sets your mind to respond not to common sense and judgment, but to training
You really don't have time to think: I'm going the wrong way
I should be going the other way
He won a Bronze Star
Nobody is looking for medals
Everyone wants to live another day
Don't misunderstand
Maybe that's a good thing
Candy Crowley, CNN, Washington
Remarkable interviews and a reminder that what these men and women are going through right now in Iraq, they will remember for the rest of their lives
That's our coverage this hour
Who looks out for the unlikely prospect of Iraqi aircraft, and the more likely prospect of Iraqi missiles or artillery
Does your mindset change across the border into Iraq
No, because I am in an area which I don't know where the enemy could be and I might get to the airplane, by the time I get out of the airplane I'm thinking the same way
The hair on the back of my neck starts standing up, then something's going wrong
As a precaution, the crew starts turning the huge plane in circles to see what the targets do
Ultimately it's discovered the targets are U.S. combat helicopters
Minutes later the search and rescue helicopter arrives for its refueling
Watch the flash from our night vision camera as the plane's fuel line connects with the chopper
Both aircraft fly at 125 miles per hour gingerly over enemy land
At times they are only 50 feet apart with the chopper's rotor blades getting closer
Looking with the naked eye out of the plane, the helicopter is impossible to see
The pitch-black maneuver ends after 10 minutes
Again, we know where we're going
We all fly with bulletproof vests in case the plane goes down
We also fly with parachutes in case we need to get out before the plane goes down
But three airmen aboard this plane have parachutes for a different reason
They are the Pararescue jumpers, or PJs who jump off the plane for rescue missions
I mean it's probably the most - the best feeling in the world knowing that your purpose is really defined at that moment
No rescues were necessary on this sortie
Do you have any fear
Everybody has a little bit of fear but I think it's a good thing in this circumstance
This crew could be back on another mission in as few as 24 hours
This is a very busy base
We want to give you a look right now at the aircraft coming in for landings
It looks like LAX on a Sunday night and this is what it's been like for the past 11 days
We have just watched multitudes of warplanes land, multitudes of warplanes take off and this may be the busiest night of the campaign
Wolf, back to you
Gary Tuchman in an air base near the Iraq border, thanks very much, Gary Tuchman
General Richard Myers will be my special guest on a special late addition
That's at noon Eastern, nine A.M
Pacific tomorrow
That's Sunday and I'll be back Judy and at the top of the hour for Wolf Blitzer Reports
We'll have a complete wrap of all the day's late breaking developments
In the meantime, back to Judy Woodruff in Washington
We'll be watching you both times at the top of the hour and certainly for late edition on Sunday
Thanks Wolf
Greg Milam is with the U.K. forces in southern Iraq
Seemingly deserted, these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to British forces in Iraq
This is what we're coming across a lot of these, 30 mil, 60 mil, 80 mil, even 120 mil
So there's plenty still out there that will have to be recovered because they can be used
Do you know when this place was last used
I mean do you know
I'm not too sure but judging by some of this, it's been here quite a long time so whether it's been used recently by them - there was an Intel upbeat saying that they were possibly coming back to try and get this to use against them
Grenades, mortars, all sorts of ammunition abandoned by Iraqi soldiers but there for the taking
The job of these Royal Engineers is to clear this and many other mountains of armaments and destroy them
Some are too unstable to be moved and have to be blown up on the spot
The rest is carried way out into the desert
With the coalition forces moving forward the last thing they want is weaponry like this lurking behind them
With the amounts of ammunition and weapons left about, if they'd used those systems, that amount of weapon it would have given us a considerable amount of trouble trying to take the positions
With much of this weaponry there is only one safe thing to do
No one in the British forces here is willing to take any risks
Greg Milam, Sky News, Southern Iraq
That's something to look at
CNN's Chris Plante is chasing all that down for us at the Pentagon right now
Hello Chris
Hi, Judy
That's right
So it won't change our overall rules of engagement
It doesn't effect the operation at large but to protect our soldiers it clearly requires great care
So certainly an unpleasant development today Judy and another item on the docket over here today is the failure of a number of cruise missiles
Tomahawk land detect missiles being from launched from ships in the eastern Mediterranean and in the Red Sea have suffered a number of failures
The Pentagon says a total of seven of the cruise missiles have failed crashing in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia
The missiles are programmed so that they don't detonate until they reach their target
If they go astray, then the warheads never arm but claiming that it's about one percent of the warheads
They've fired 675 or so tomahawk land detect missiles from ships and seven of those have failed
Chris, very quickly, new information from the Pentagon today about any concerns they have about Saddam Hussein's ongoing air defense capability
Well, no major concern
The reason that they're still in tact according to today's briefing was that they had not turned them on and as long as they don't turn them on, the U.S. has trouble locating them
All right
We're paying attention to all those details for us, Chris Plante at the Pentagon
Coming up, coalition forces control several parts of southern Iraq but they still face some serious problems including pockets of resistance
That story when we come back
A serious problem they still face though, pockets of resistance
Reporter David Bowden is with the British forces in Umm Qasr in southern Iraq
It's not pretty and there's no please and thank you but for the Marines, every door potentially hides a gunman and when your life is on the line, manners go out the window
This patrol did find hidden weapons
They're not the first and they're unlikely to be the last
The Marines believe they have a firm hold on Umm Qasr right now but they can't afford to slack in their grip and allow those who are hostile to the coalition forces to regroup and begin again their cycle of violence
The Marines with their snipers have now snipers have now spread their area of operations north to include the town of Umm Kiou
As in Umm Qasr before it, they're here to clear out the opponents to regime change
It was a painful and bloody mistake
We've now evacuated them out and the enemy now have either fled or they've been captured
The Royal Marines are satisfied they are in control of this small corner of Iraq
Their task now is to keep it that way. David Bowden in southern Iraq
That report filed just a short time ago
Well, CNN analyst Ken Pollack who is with the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution is with me now
He is an expert on the Iraqi military and its tactics and weapons
Right
I mean we're seeing one of the great advantages of U.S. and British forces now, Judy, which is that they're superbly trained troops
They have training in a whole variety of different missions and they're adapting
They recognize now they went in with some false assumptions about the kind of reception that they were going to face
The plan that was implemented had some inherent risks in it, risks to the supply line, risks in terms of not clearing cities and they're shifting
They're changing and the troops are trained well enough to be able to deal with that
You've seen U.S. Central Command bringing up additional forces like the 82nd Airborne Division to better deal with these long supply lines, get control over the cities and so I think that U.S. and British forces are beginning to stabilize the battlefield
So as an onlooker, as somebody who's studied the Iraqi capabilities, is it your sense that the coalition can continue to adjust to whatever they deal with
Absolutely
One of the things I think we're likely to see is that the Iraqis are going to have a tougher time adapting than U.S
forces are
Typically what you've seen in the Iraqi armed forces is the change has to come from the top
It doesn't come from the ground up
You don't have ground commanders calling back and saying hey, we'd like to try this tactic or this seems to work
Tell everybody else to do the same thing
Instead the high command has to identify a problem, come up with a solution and transmit it down
There's no way around that but U.S. forces, British forces are beginning to adapt to it
I want to ask you about you mentioned coalition forces going in expecting more support from ordinary Iraqi people
I just interviewed a gentleman, native of Iraq, who talks to his family there all the time and he says they live in Baghdad 20, 30, 50 of them and he said they do the view the Americans as invaders
They hate Saddam Hussein
They don't like what he's doing but they don't think the Americans are the answer
All right
They remember that the United States betrayed them in 1991
The U.S. didn't finish Saddam then
President Bush - then President Bush called on them to rise up and then the U.S. did nothing and so they're deeply suspicious of what we have in mind
Which raises questions going forward
What's the significance of that
Well, if it's true and obviously we don't know just yet but if it's true, it is very significant because it's effectively the
Chances are it was an Iraqi surface to air missile
We're going to go quickly to northern Iraq now where we find CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman
There's been some action in that area
Nick - I mean - I'm sorry
Ben, we can make you out just barely but tell us what you've been seeing
Yes
Not just Iraqi positions behind us, in addition to that in the direction of Mosul as well which is a major northern Iraqi city about 28 miles to the west of me
Ben, what is your best understanding of what it is on the ground that the coalition forces are going after the
They have mortars
They have anti-tank guns, hundreds of men along this very long ridge that basically runs from the north to the south
Ben, very - we thank you very much for that and we'll be coming back to you as the night - as the night wears on
We're getting close to the bottom of the hour
We're going to get some headlines at the hour right now with Heidi Collins
I hope they get a little rest
Slowly humanitarian aid is rolling into southern Iraq but dramatic scenes like this one of a crowd tearing into the supplies on a convoy truck only underscores how desperate the need is
Correspondent Martin Geissler files this report from the Iraqi town of Safwan
Now they are desperate
Within seconds the Kuwaiti aid workers who had organized this trip were overpowered by the mob
These desperate scenes are exactly what the aide agencies wanted to avoid
This is survival of the fittest
Only the healthy and strong can get to the food
The weak and the ill are left with nothing
Despite this effort to help the Iraqi people, resentment is never far away
We hate U.S. We hate British, England
What do you think about Saddam's regime
Saddam's very good man
As the supplies ran out the mood swung from frantic to uglyf
We, as a consequence, have had to move out
It's simply too dangerous
This is a clear indication that despite the coalition reassurances that this part of Iraq is safe and despite the aid being brought into the people here, it is still a very, very volatile area
Tonight here the strong are eating
The weak still go hungry
Martin Geissler, ITV News, Safwan southern Iraq
So many different pictures we are getting from across that country
Well, they are making their voices heard at home and abroad
Congresswoman Maxine Waters was among those scheduled to attend
CNN's Rusty Dornin is with us from San Francisco
I'm getting various estimates on the crowd
We did want to show you an interesting thing here
Some folks are showing some solidarity with the speakers here
You're looking at some of San Francisco's police department's officers
I did ask them why they did that
They said they were wearing skullcaps so they decided to adopt this to show solidarity
They said the department has not made any statement about whether they think that's all right or not
So far, very peaceful
As I said, there have been a few verbal exchanges but one of the most enthusiastically received speakers here was Bessam Al-Husaini, an Iraqi American
He's with the Iraqi American Council
How do you feel about supporting the troops
ITN correspondent Tim Ewart reports
They are facing Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard, his finest soldiers
But for all the resistance, coalition aircraft rule the skies and coalition technology is overwhelmingly superior
U.S
commanders believe the Republican Guard is a doomed force
How does the Iraqi American Council feel
Well the Iraqi American have been waiting for this liberation and they want to get rid of Saddam so bad and they will have to take it the way it's been offered to us
He would love to see this and would draw on this emotion from the Arab world and the European country
Now you said you did talk to your family in Baghdad as well and they also are somewhat suspicious of the Americans
Well, I mean the Iraqi people have been the primary victim from the whole thing
Yeah my family, you know, still in fear
You know they stay in one room
They boarded all the - all the windows and they built with a brick one of the windows facing the street
I mean yes, you know, my prayer to them but we can only do so much
We can live in liberty and freedom soon
Now I understand some of the people here have been threatened by anti-war protesters
Have you had anyone either threatening you or
No, no problem
OK
Thank you very much
Thank you
It is wrapping up this afternoon and it looks like the civil disobedience acts by the anti-protesters are scheduled to get underway once again next week
The situation here appears to be increasingly tense
A few moments ago, out on the horizon, not very far ahead of the U.S. Army's 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, we heard more than a few explosions
The U.S. Army's 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry has compiled a rather extraordinary record in the past several days
It was the Army which assigned me to the 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, and that was extremely fortuitous
It was like sitting in a poker game and drawing four aces, because this is a crack unit
It's the tip of the tip of the spear
We just heard an incoming what the hell
No, no, I don't know what it is
Recall Winston Churchill's old quote, There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at and missed
What you try to do is stay calm and continue your broadcasting
We're hearing incoming
We're not sure what it is
We see some stuff in the sky
We may have to break this off
I think we're going to break off this live shot for the time being
We're not sure what we see up there
Goodbye
We've got to dive for vehicles, we think
See you
Bye
We'd like to now show you what we call Old Betsy, a re-used, secondhand U.S. Army Humvee that we've been traveling with
Any bullet will pass through it, even a .22 caliber bullet
You can see our body armor draped on the door
This is what we've literally been living in
This is the kitchen, when we're down, and we're very fortunate, because we've got a teapot
That's my cubby hole
It's extraordinary cramped, because sandbag the floor, in case we hit a mine
That's all the space I have to eat and sleep in
You don't sleep
You really don't sleep out here
You have to realize, they've been riding along, bouncing along in these tanks for probably six or more hours now
And if you ride inside that tank, it is like riding in the bowels of a dragon
They roar, they screech
The hardest part of the trip is personal discomfort
We cannot tell you the levels of personal discomfort we've experienced
The extraordinary sandstorms, the bitter cold nights
The most uncomfortable thing is having to sleep sitting up in a Humvee with sandbags under your feet, your knees at your chin
That's excruciatingly uncomfortable, not something that you would wish on anybody but a contortionist
Let me give you an example of what the dust like
Look at this
We have been through days of dust like that
Actually, they're very close, that is to say, no more than 40 yards away, but the dust and sand are blowing so badly you're getting these vague images
It's like being in a blizzard, except unfortunately, the sand doesn't melt as the snow does
What we eat is what the Army calls MREs, meals ready to eat
And I must say, they're pretty darn good
And of course, everybody fights for the best ones
The treats are things like the M&amp;Ms and the breakfast toasties
Let me hold the camera and show you my crew
On camera left is Charlie Miller, he's been our superb and intrepid cameraman
On my right is Jeff Barweis, a brilliant satellite engineer
That's the crew which really brings you these pictures
The pictures you're seeing are absolutely phenomenal
These are live pictures of the 7th Cavalry racing across the desert
You've never seen battlefield pictures like these before
A report from CNN's Kelly Wallace when we return
Many Israelis were fearing that quiet would come to an end
And it did on this day
We can show you some pictures from earlier Sunday
People here tell us the cafe was filled with people enjoying the spring weather
And many soldier
Two soldiers were down here
Many blood
Many people skip from here
Big paranoia
I'm Kelly Wallace, CNN, reporting from Netanyahu, Israel
A baseball legend rallies the troops
Up next, pitching great Roger Clemens talks about his experiences meeting U.S. service members in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf
Hi, Judy
Thank you very much
As of an hour or so ago, we got word from the battlefield that U.S. forces were just 15 miles away from the southern edge of Baghdad
And they may be even closer right now
The Pentagon says two of the Republican Guard divisions defending Baghdad are no longer credible forces
Scenes from Najaf may also be bolstering the troops' spirit
Iraqis who initially were cautious when U.S. forces arrived in Najaf ended cheering them on, shaking their hands and patting their backs
Indeed, all the arrows on the Army's map seem to be pointing in the direction of the southern suburbs of Baghdad
And then the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division secured the town of Karbala
Yesterday we were about 50 miles from the southern suburbs of Baghdad
We have perhaps have that distance
Walter Rodgers, CNN, with the U.S. 7th Cavalry in the Iraqi desert
And it's a similar story from CNN's Karl Penhaul who is now just miles from the southern outskirts of the Iraqi capital
Here's his report just filed a few minutes ago
In fact, it's going much faster than many of the U.S. commanders on the ground predicted
The armor, and mechanized infantry, and artillery pieces and personnel on the ground are moving at rapid speeds
Let's get an update now on casualties on Operation Iraqi Freedom
U.S. Central Command says 4,500 Iraqis have been taken prisoner
One less than yesterday after that dramatic rescue of Private First Class Jessica Lynch
That's all coming up on our special edition of WOLF BLITZER REPORTS at the top of the hour
Judy, back to you
All right, Wolf, and we will be watching
Thanks very much
Well, at the Pentagon briefing this afternoon, officials describing several units of the Republican Guard as effectively no longer being a credible fighting force
Our Jamie McIntyre our senior military affairs correspondent is with us now
Hello, again, Jamie
Well Judy, the Pentagon is beginning to see positive signs that it hadn't seen for awhile
First of all, as we saw just a few moments ago on CNN, the pictures of some of the actual happy Iraqi citizens welcoming U.S. troops, that taking place in Najaf
They met lighter than expected resistance
They may just suddenly be effective on the ground
We believe they have the capability now
At the U.S. Central Command briefing this morning at the forward headquarters in Doha, Qatar, General Vincent Brooks said that the U.S. would be continuing to approach Baghdad
Is there a chance that coalition forces could, at this point, be overestimating the strength of what's left of the opposition
Well, they might be
And that might be a good thing
They are taking it very cautiously
No one, again, they stress the most dangerous part of this could be ahead
Could involve chemical weapons
Could be a very dangerous time
We notice they said they did not want to use the word destroyed, in fact, they said let others do that
Jamie McIntyre at the Pentagon
For a look at what might lie ahead for U.S. forces, let's turn to our Miles O'Brien in Atlanta
Thank you very much, Judy
To help guide us through all this discussion about red zones, and daggers and exactly what is the strength of the Republican Guard, we turn to Colonel Patrick Lang
He spent some time in the Defence Intelligence Agency, among other things
Colonel, good to have you with us
What do you suppose right now would be the governor on the forward advance
Is it the Republican Guard or is it the U.S. and coalition supply lines
Or both
You're welcome
Well, they are close enough up to Baghdad now so that the supply line issue is probably not a big one since they had time to restock, food, fuel and ammunition
So, probably the main thing is combing through the rubble that the air force has left of these Republican Guard divisions to make sure there are no strong points that you leave behind, that could threaten your lines of supply once they get past
Once they are satisfied they are through all that, I would imaging there will be a pause while they start to reconnoiter into Baghdad, probing hard to see how much resistance there really is
Well, let me ask you that
First of all, I just wanted to tell viewers where we just took our satellite imagery
This is that Karbala area which is about 50 miles from Baghdad
Baghdad is roughly in that direction from there
We know the vanguard is supposedly as close as 15 miles
One of the next key points along the way here is Saddam international airport
Do you suppose that is a key target right now
Oh, I'm sure it is
I mean a feature of that importance would always be something you'd want to hold
And if the front stabilizes between there and the downtown Baghdad, they'll start using it for a fixed wing aircraft as well
Control of these highways will be crucial won't it
Yeah, these are the high-speed approaches into the heart of the city and armored forces like the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division just love high-speed approaches
They will try to go down those things, cutting the city up into sectors as best they can, and then work on the specific sectors of the city they think are a key terrain
It's a big city, about the size of Philadelphia or thereabouts
Some have said Chicago is a good analogy
Tremendous amount of force needed to control a city of that source, or am a wrong
Well, it depends on the attitude of the populous, which is not clear yet
If the population, in fact, or at least a big part of them like the Shia half of the population, if they want to be liberated, then you can control them with a fairly small force
If, in fact, a lot of people in the city don't want to be liberated and you're never going to know that until you try, then you're going to need a much larger force, and we might end up waiting a couple of weeks for reinforcements
Based on what you've seen so far, what is your sense of that
They rose up, didn't get American support
Do you suppose it will be a different story in Baghdad
Is there a lot of latent hatred for Saddam Hussein that will come out
Yes, there is, but these folks are going to be mighty cautious
They have a long history of being kicked around by the Sunni Arab population of central Iraq
And they don't have any particular reason to trust us, so far
So they'll wait and see what happens
It's the other people in the city you have to worry about, who are ethnically much the same as the Saddam Hussein regime
And their behavior right now is unpredictable
Always helps Miles to hear a voice of experience
Thank you and thanks to Colonel Lang
When we come back, hopes rising among investors
We're going to check in with Rhonda Schaffler at the stock exchange in just a moment
As coalition forces push ahead in their march toward Baghdad, they have encountered some resistance in the Shiite holy city of Karbala
But American troops and their superior technology have turned out to be a key factor in the fighting there
ITN correspondent Tim Ewart reports
These are soldiers of the U.S. 3rd Infantry, fighting near Karbala, southwest of Baghdad
They are facing Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard, his finest soldiers
But for all the resistance, coalition aircraft rule the skies and coalition technology is overwhelmingly superior
U.S. commanders believe the Republican Guard is a doomed force
We will approach Baghdad
The dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of the regime right now and will remain pointed at it until the regime is gone
To the south, more black smoke over the town of Basra
Tim Ewart, ITV News, southern Iraq
CNN's Brent Sadler is there
A back road leading to Kirkuk, the heartland of northern Iraq's oil wealth
A road that's now in the hands of Iraqi Kurdish forces
Occupying these positions, strattled along a crescent-shaped front line east of Kirkuk
This is the end of the road for Kurdish forces manning this remote checkpoint
But with special permission, they let us through
This territory is within easy artillery range of Saddam Hussein's forces and circling Kirkuk
The oil capital of northern Iraq is visible behind me, just over there, a harmless flare of burning gases is easily identifiable
Iraq's precious oil field remain intact
Also intact, Kirkuk's defenses, in the distant haze
Iraq's armed opposition, including these Kurds, waits on the sidelines to join the fray, if America asks
This is about freedom for Iraq
This is about the liberation of Iraq, and we Iraqis must shoulder the responsibility of helping in the process of liberation
Brent Sadler, CNN, near Kirkuk in northern Iraq
Let's check in with CNN's Gary Tuchman at an air base near Iraq
Gary you've seen it firsthand from the first moments
Well, that's right, Judy
We come to you from a base near the Iraqi border
They also fly F-16s
There are also Marine FA-18s and Marine Heriers at this base
And we spent part of the day at that base
This is Talil, Iraq
The Talil Air Base
It's now a major staging point
You know you are in Iraq when you drive down the road coming into the base and see the portrait of Saddam Hussein
You can see the main one here on the bottom and also here messages like, we won, April 1, 2003
Want to give you a look
There's a lot of security personnel here
You can look over there and you can see the military vehicles
These are Air Force Security Forces with their rifles patrolling the entrance
We're near the town of Nasiriya
But this base now is considered secure enough to make it a major staging point for the coalition
A short time ago we talked to a pilot at this base who has been to that Iraqi base and he too says he has signed that mural right on Saddam Hussein's sash
And we attrit the Medina forces down to less than 50 percent
Lieutenant Colonel Webb is telling us he has a mission this very evening
A total over the last two weeks now of close to 24,000 sorties
Before we go, one more thing we want to tell you about, superstitions
Military people are very superstitious, like many of us are
Here at this particular base they get their MREs, their MREs are their Meals Ready to Eat
They come in a bag
And when you get an MRE you get your meal and you get a little treat with it
What a lot of people here at this base do, when their treat happens to be this one, this is the candy called Charms, many of the people refuse to eat their Charms
They consider it a good luck charm to keep their Charms in their clothes and not to eat them
So one little superstitious tale for you, Judy
Back to you
Well, I'm one of those who thinks that we need to pay attention to our superstitions
Gary, one another quick question for you
Are you able to say, are they actually using it or getting much use out of it
They also fly these HH-60 helicopters, they're the search and rescue helicopters used in case they have to search and find somebody on the ground
They stage there and refuel
But right now, none of them are permanently based there, although the plan is for that to eventually happen
All right, Gary Tuchman with some Charms
You saw him holding it
Could Tony Blair be in line for a gold medal
Tales of how some in Congress want to honor the British prime minister
Thanks very much, Judy
British forces say they're consolidating their position in Basra's key suburbs
They reportedly are exploring the option of joining forces against Saddam Hussein
Reporter Carl Dinnon of Britain's ITN filed this report
Wrecked armor by the sides of the road suggests there has been some Iraqi opposition
Meanwhile, coalition commanders posted American special forces were now operating at will
It seems to have been abandoned, but the United States said it was still on the trail of Saddam and his closest circle
We remain cautiously optimistic
We take that very seriously
We take it in a sober fashion
And at the same time, we remain prepared to continue operations
That means it's practically inoperative
The noose appears to be tightening on Saddam Hussein
The question is, how desperate he will get before he is finally toppled
Carl Dinnon, ITV News, Iraq
In the southern city of Najaf, home to one of Islam's holiest sites, moments of tension that could have gone either way earlier today
Angry locals who did not understand their intentions clearly showed their intentions as well
CNN's Ryan Chilcote is in Najaf
We're going to get to him shortly
But Judy Woodruff, back in Washington, has breaking news Judy
Wolf, we're going to break in here, because the parents of Jessica Lynch, who live in Palestine, West Virginia, are before the microphones, I'm told, just about to talk with reporters
They're walking toward the press
Let's listen
Good afternoon
We appreciate y'all coming out for what you're doing for Jessie and all of the other troops that are missing
We've been waiting all day word from the doctors, and they have successively done one surgery on her
There will be other surgeries to do that
It's going to take time and patience
But she's great and she's doing good
She's in real good spirits
We talked to her
We talked to her before the surgery, we talked to her after the surgery, and she's doing good
Can't you think
Yes, a bunch, but my mind's blank
The doctor has completed one surgery on her back
They have released the pressure on a nerve, and realigned all the disks and put plates and stuff in it, and that was because she didn't have any feeling in her feet
So he, he's pretty sure right now that that will relieve, relieve the tension, and her feet will be able to move
The doctor has not seen any of this
They will do surgery again tomorrow on her legs
And we are just waiting to get that good news too
We talked to her before and after the surgery, like I said, and she's just, she just sounded real good
Of course, this morning she was a little groggy
But yet, she was good, because it was early
And then this afternoon, after the surgery, she was our Jessie again
We know she's in good spirits, because they told her they was gonna put pink casts on her legs and arms, and she had pink casts when she was in the third grade on her arm so we know she her mind is working good
So she's in good spirits, and we hope the surgery will go good tomorrow, just as well as it did today
You said she was in good spirits
Can you describe your conversation
I teased her again about the Army jeeps and she said, I know where there's a bunch of that we can find
So, we know she's in good spirits
She was asking for a hairbrush
Gregory Lynch, the father of Jessica Lynch, and Jessica's mother talking to reporters, saying they have talked to her today, both before and after surgery, that she says she's feeling good
They say she will be good
But they said the doctors did go in and apparently do some work on her spinal cord or spinal column
He said to relieve some pressure on a nerve
They were concerned because she didn't have feeling in her feet
Thanks very much, Judy
This is not probably a comparable situation, is it
Not in any way
And one of the reasons is because we have armored fighting vehicles there in Baghdad, and we will use them
Those tanks have 120-millimeter smoothbore gun on them
The Bradleys have 25-millimetre chain guns and coaxial machine guns
That's a lot of mobile protective gunfire
Completely different from the Mogadishu situation in which we did not have such vehicles
And we also are not going to use similar tactics there
All right
We want to show you an animation, and share with our viewers, maybe you can point out a few things about this
What we've depicted here is something here which shows some armor sort of off the wings here, right over here is a mosque
We depict that to show that's something you obviously want to stay clear as we just saw with the Ryan Chilcote piece from Najaf
As we get a little bit closer here, in a typical scenario like this, you might very well have Republican Guard snipers up on balconies like this, and possibly up on the roofs of buildings and anti-aircraft artillery or artillery encampments like that
What we have presented her is an armored column with air support coming in
How much jeopardy is a column like this in as it goes through these concrete canyons in a city
It's a great question
I think the animation is good because it does show that you can hide literally anywhere in a city environment, and that is why movement through an urban area is very, very dangerous
We'll use patience and finesse
We will take the time to locate the enemy, surround the blocks and the buildings that he is in
We'd like to resume with that animation if we could
That's Saddam International Airport
That's another segment
Can we get back to the animation
And I'd like to just finish this out
Here we go
Ad we move it along, you'll see eventually the troops will come marching in
In this case, slightly off target here because you see them all going in the front door
Well, typically, if they do go in, which is generally the option of last resort, but if we do have to go in, often we'll try to go in from the top of the building down
One of the reasons is because we use grenades a lot in clearing buildings, and grenades ten to offend downhill rather than uphill
So, you always want them going down staircases rather than having to try to throw them up the staircase
Interesting, all right
Thank you very much for your time
We appreciate it Judy
Thank you, Miles and thank you Colonel Leonhard
Meantime, the U.S. reportedly has hundreds of troops poised to reinforce the Baghdad international airport, now under the control of American troops
A source tells CNN's Nic Robertson, some Iraqi Republican Guard forces are gathering close to the airport
Columns of coalition forces keep pressing north and tightening the noose on Baghdad
CNN's Central Command says some 2,500 Republican Guard forces surrendered, that is, between Kut and Baghdad
While coalition forces say they have secured the facility, that's not the case in the surrounding area
It was a showpiece of his regime
Now Saddam International Airport is controlled by coalition troops and, tonight, it has a new name, Baghdad International
A passenger jet burned out on the tarmac
Wreckage burning in a hangar as U.S. troops rush in
Building by building, they swept the terminal complex, then moved on to secure the runway
The fall of his airport is a humiliating blow for Saddam
Hopefully, this is a sign that we're able to send to the residents of Baghdad that we're here and they can rise up and deal with the regime appropriately
Here, the remains of an Iraqi armored car, and by its side the body of an Iraqi soldier, all that remains of a column that pushed up the airport road last night in a final effort to defend the airport
U.S. troops are now knocking on the door of Baghdad
The patchy, somewhat disorganized defense of the airport last night has left coalition commanders with several questions
James Mates, ITV News, with the U.S. marines, south of Baghdad
Iraqis pulled back on the road to Mosul as CNN's Jane Arraf reports from the battlefield
It's a bridge over the river on the main road to Mosul
The Peshmerga are just down the road, and the Iraqis have retreated, but they're still holding on to the bridge
Are you coming here
In this vehicle, the only Iraqi casualties we saw
Their military radio and guns indicating they were combatants
It's still smoldering, this truck with three Iraqi soldiers
These were lying on the ground next to the truck
Somebody picked them up
It's an I.D. card, presumably for one of the soldiers
The only thing you can really tell from it is that he was 27 years old
And a snapshot from when his life was still ahead of him
Other evidence of a hurried retreat amid the smoldering vehicles, a discarded gas mask
Military documents
Notebooks with verses from the Koran
The village of Manguba, just 32 kilometers, about 23 miles from Mosul is now in Kurdish hands
One Kurdish soldier did the honors of tearing up a poster of Saddam Hussein
Not just the poster, but the frame and cardboard backing as well
They've been waiting a long time
Jane Arraf, CNN, on the bridge over the Khoser River in northern Iraq
Thanks very much
Judy, dangerous assignment for all of our reporters, our embedded journalists
We'll have more on him at 5:00 on our special edition of WOLF BLITZER REPORTS
Until then, thanks, Judy, back to you
Thanks, Wolf
And we'll be watching
Michael Kelly, of course, with Atlantic Monthly, and a columnist for the Washington Post
And U.S. Central Command says more than 4,000 Iraqis have been captured, but British officials believe that figure is much higher
Another 15 Americans listed as missing in action
His story is especially poignant
His father is a navy commander
We're going to ask our military analyst
That's coming up
Dominating the city gates to Basra
Saddam Hussein and his henchmen still claim to control this southern port
But the British want to send a powerful symbolic message
Soldiers are here to tear down the regime and all it stands for
The approach can seem frustratingly slow, but day by day, the Desert Rats are exerting more control
Checkpoints meant to filter out Iraqi hardliners
Drastic action is need to convince a dubious population
Get down, get down
These are men singled out by locals and believed by army intelligence to be behind much of the brutality and corruption
Most are not accused of specific crimes but suspected of being part of the state-sponsored climate of fear
The party's influence extends to every corner of Iraqi society
In two small communities, we witnessed more than 70 people being rounded up
Some are clearly terrified of what lies ahead, uncertain of their fate, overcome by nerves
But as it ended, there was no British apology for the scale of the operation
We came in firm, we came in fair
We gave a good warning before we came in
This is not a tactic that can be regularly repeated, or the British risk being accused of installing their own rule of terror
Despite the discomfort of a few, there's a conviction that this is a night's work that will benefit the majority
Juliet Bremner in Basra
Well, there has been a terrible discovery by some other British troops in southern Iraq
At its daily briefing, U.S. Central Command says Operation Iraqi Freedom is far from finished in Baghdad, even though U.S
forces are inside the Iraqi capital
At the Pentagon, Barbara Starr reports officials say today begins a new strategy in the skies over Baghdad
Now the operating plan includes both ground and air missions
The Palestine Hotel is where much of the international press corps is based
Hello again, Miles
Hello again, Judy
You know, just those two words together, I think, scare a lot of people because of all the things that can go wrong
You know, I'm impressed, looking at this map, it almost looks like a chess game, kind of sterile
That is couldn't be further from the truth, could it
Absolutely not
This is very clean and it's very orderly
Suddenly when we show the videotape and we start to go there, you'll see just how conflicted an environment that is
And all happening so quickly
Let's roll some tape
Just there, I mean, just getting the door out of the way, you can see where the weapons have to go
Now, you just see this soldier right here, he's going to his sidearm to make a little bit more mobile
And he's got to be careful of his muzzle pointing at his partner right here
Now, he's going to go that direction, because that room is clear
Go ahead and stop the tape
So
All right
Now, what about this, this armor
Tell us how they're equipped with armor there
Level 4 armor, this is not just for frag
This will also stop bullets
And there's a difference
The normal flak jacket will stop fragments from grenades, et cetera
This is a plate that will actually stop and deform a bullet
All right
Let's roll tape and continue on here and talk about
Now, I notice his hand his sidearm is attached to him
That's for
Exactly
So he goes down the hallway, and you can see once that's called clear, straight trigger finger, in case there's any sympathetic muscle tightening, there's no problem
Sort of ready but not quite
Absolutely
Immediately making entry with the thing, and then pying the room out, getting angles of vision as they clear it
But look at that, a dark space from a lighted space
Who knows what's in the recesses
All right
Let's roll that second tape quickly, and we'll show you a
couple more tips from Kelly's perspective
So far, what we're seeing is pretty much textbook
ery different circumstance
But stop the tape right here
Oop, we missed it, we missed it
No, just roll it
Just go ahead and roll it
All of that has to be accounted for as well, not just the space in here
Your back is not covered
Many angles you've got to watch for
Now, you see right here, he's got a sidearm, he's calling the team in
All the rear is Now, stop the tape
Imagine a person that is concealed anywhere in here
I mean, you could have anyone with a rifle back in these areas here
Up in this area here, here
No, he wouldn't have that
But let me ask you this
Also that the garb, there's a cultural issue here
That provides a lot of cover for weapons if need be, righ
Absolutely
And someones might say, Well, why put their hands on their head like this
Because, you know, you the hands hurt
And I won't be able to determine what you're doing with your face
Where are your hands and what do they hold
All right
Let's roll it real quickly and we'll make a few more points, if we could
A lot of fear in their faces here
You see, by the way, they all have radios, I notice they have, like, a little headset there
That allows them to communicate
Immediate communications, absolutely
All these areas up in here, you know, could be subjected to people hiding, et cetera
Now you've got people coming down that have already been cleared
Look at the fear on the faces
They don't understand what's going on
And you want to keep them calm, and
Very calm, reassure them that this isn't about them
Now, here's a little bit more aggressive stance
Exactly
Go ahead and stop tape
Stop it right there
Oh, we missed it again
Obviously, that person is doing something that that
I would say aggressive is a good word for that
All right, Kelly McCann, thank you for some insights
And that compound that by a city of 5 million, it kind of boggles the mind and really gives you a sense of what lies head for U.S
and coalition forces
Thanks very much for your insights
Thanks, Miles and Kelly
I've always wondered what happened who covers the last man or woman in one of those operations, but that's something for your next conversation
Thanks very much
An investigation is under way at a makeshift morgue in southern Iraq after a gruesome discovery by some British troops
Tim Ewart of ITN News reports on evidence of atrocities at an abandoned Iraqi military base
It was a discovery that horrified the soldiers who made it
The remains of hundreds of men were found in plastic bags and Unsealed hard-board coffins
British troops found the bodies at an abandoned Iraqi military base on the outskirts of Azubayr
The evidence suggested it was the scene of appalling atrocities
The teeth in many of the skulls had been broken, and bones appeared to be wrapped in strips of military uniform
The coffins were there
It was a bit more of a surprise when I discovered the bags with the human remains inside
Inside a neighboring building, there was evidence of cells and a catalog of photographs of the dead
Outside, soldiers discovered what they described as a purpose- built shooting gallery, the brickwork behind it riddled with bullets
Identity cards revealed the names of some of the dead
Forensic specialists will now visit the scene and hope to establish the truth of what happened here and when
Today's discovery seems to provide shocking evidence of atrocities under Saddam Hussein's regime
Most people are afraid to talk openly about what's been happening here
But when they do, British soldiers believe, more horrors will come to light
Tim Ewart, ITV News, Azubayr
Well, from a gruesome finding to a dangerous one in central Iraq
U.S. troops work to clear that area of Iraqi weapons, coming up
We've been hearing about the situation in northern and southern Iraq
Now to central Iraq, where coalition forces say they are now in charge
And they are coming across some major munitions finds
The caches were apparently abandoned by retreating Iraqi forces
One such cache turned up in the city of Karbala, a strategic military point about 60 miles to the south of Baghdad
CNN's Ryan Chilcote is embedded with the 101st Airborne Division, and he has the story
Can you show us what you've been finding today
Roger
Well, this is about the third cache we've found today
We've been finding them nonstop, and it's a really tedious affair
I've got an assortment of weapons right here, ranging from AK-47s, to over here, behind them, you'll see mortar sights, 60-millimeter and 81
Off on the far left, you'll see a second-generation starscope, kind of outdated, but still works
If you keep shifting over, you'll see stabilizer fins for mortar rounds
On the back here, you'll see both 60- and 82-millimeter mortars
These are well equipped
Well, they're very well equipped
Rocket-propelled grenades
Been finding a lot of these lately
Now, is this a you said you'd seen a lot of weapons caches recently found
Is this a large cache
No, I'd say this is about a medium cache
This looks like a lot of weapons
It looks like a lot of weapons, but it's really not
This technically, this would probably would outfit a platoon, a platoon of
Keep going on
This is a little bit more advanced, these are 25-millimeter shells, and each one of those silver boxes you see behind them hold 50 of these shells
That's a little bit above us
That's actually going into mechanized and armor
All right
And you were talking about the makers, where some of these weapons are coming from, and you were expressing surprise to me
A majority of these are coming from on this box, but Jordan and France
We have a very scattered, limited, and Russian equipment, but like I said, France and Jordan are the main suppliers right here
Now for your guys, this is dangerous work, finding
Don't know if they're going to be booby trapped
Don't know what what's going to be there
So it's very tedious, it's got to be careful about it
Well, we've heard a whole lot about Iraq's use of human shields in defending key sites
Coalition fighters, though, use a different kind of shield
In a CNN exclusive, CNN's Kyra Phillips offers us a ride-along over the city of Baghdad with some airborne bodyguards
We won't consider the mission a success unless the Marines are happy with the product
They are coalition bodyguards over Baghdad, an airborne shield to U.S. Marines
Let them know what's coming
Let them know if anything is coming back behind them on their franks to close off the supply lines
You're now airborne over Iraq with Commander Steve Kroto's Gray Knights, the Navy's P-3 eyes in the sky
Any kind of forces that look like they may be threatening the Marines, you know, we want to let them know
However, protecting forces on the ground isn't
These men are about three hours into their mission, and the sun is starting to set
We're getting closer to it
Also on this mission, Marine Colonel Jim Lukeman and Sergeant Emilio Hernandez
They are tracking and talking to their fellow Marines on the ground
Two vehicles move across the bridge
I'm looking for enemy positions out to the front
Lukeman is warning his troops about a bridge ahead
He doesn't like what he sees
The Gray Knights fly closer and grab a clearer picture
There's some vehicular traffic, so that we know the bridge is still intact
They may be Iraqi military
So now that the Marine division on the ground has that information, they'll take that action they'll take action tactically on it
These flights can last up to 15 hours, but it's the minutes of realtime intelligence that completes the mission
Commander Steve Kroto brings his crew home after locating enemy positions and surface-to-surface missiles
It keeps the Marines safe
Flying over Iraq, Kyra Phillips, CNN
And there are late reports that the 45 wounded include the brother and a son of a Kurdish political leader
Julian Manyon of ITN has more from Northern Iraq
Trying to organize a northern front with just a few hundred U.S
Special Forces troops and the poorly armed Kurdish Peshmerga guerrillas was always going to be a high-risk exercise
But today, it all went disastrously wrong
Earlier, we had joined another convoy of U.S. Special Forces troops and Kurdish fighters as they tried to move south through country abandoned by the Iraqi army
At first, all was calm
American troops controlled the operation from a rooftop
The Iraqi gunners rapidly found our range, and we took refuge in an abandoned farm house
Get down
We finally managed to get out by car
Julian Manyon, ITV News, on the northern front
Julian Manyon with some very dramatic pictures as we look at the live pictures of Baghdad at night
We will take a short break, our live coverage continues
You just heard John reporting about it
It has been said that Saddam Hussein ruled Iraq with an iron fist
I guess you can say in the past tense
His regime has left behind some disturbing evidence to support those claims
The abandoned secret police headquarters in Basra is just one example
ITN's Bill Neely is with the Royal Marines and he takes us on a tour of Basra's chamber of horrors
Saddam Hussein's Iraq is a state of terror, and this is where it's planned and perpetrated, the headquarters of his secret police, this one in Basra
No British soldier has been here yet
Today, as I walked in, I met Iraqis, none of whom had ever been inside willingly
Yes, of course
Any people who Saddam did not like
Of course
Of course
The building is crumbling
Down we went, further to cells that had no light, little air, cockroaches, filth, and, on the ground, a gas mask and bottles of chemicals
You can imagine this every day, every month
He was one of the prisoners here
For how long
Eight years
Eight, nine, eight years
And his crime for eight years in jail
He prayed too much and was seen as a dangerous radical
More cells
But the Mukhabarat headquarters had more horrors to reveal
And they tied their hands behind and hung them and hung them for many days
So desperate are they to tell their story that they began reenacting what they and their brothers and friends have suffered
And it happened here to tens of thousands of Iraqis that Saddam's secret police deemed dangerous
This man cowered for months, crammed with 300 mothers into a huge cell
This man was here, too, with his brother
There's a prisoner under the name of Ahmed Adis Aeid
They kept records of prisoners, these and their fingerprints all that's left of them, apart from the photographs they took of exactly what they had done
If there is an evil center to Saddam Hussein's regime, then it is surely here and in other places of torture
And there's plenty here that we simply cannot show you
In this block, it was men over here, hundreds of them, and women and children here
To call all this a chamber of horrors is a cliche
And this place is beyond cliche
On the ground, I found a book called The Psychology of Interrogation, as if the men who worked here for Saddam needed a handbook
I was glad of the fresh air and glad to leave, glad I could
Bill Neely, ITV News, Basra
Unspeakable
Our Jeff Greenfield examines that question when we come back
Some thoughts now on the dangers from our senior analyst, Jeff Greenfield
Sean Flynn, son of the famous actor Errol Flynn, disappeared in Cambodia in 1970
Their safety, their lives, may depend on those troops
Not likely
And that raises a bigger question
In an interview with broadcasting and cable magazine, CBS News President Andrew Heyward said of the neutrality notion quote It's one of the stupidest things I've ever heard
This story is going to be told from a U.S. point of view
We are American reporters, the ones with the troops
But whether in the old Soviet Union or Nazi Germany or South Africa or Iraq, respect for the facts does not require a reporter to throw his values over the side
Jeff Greenfield, CNN, New York
That's tonight at 9:00 p.m. Eastern, 6:00 Pacific

It turns out this is actually a story about a brother, Lieutenant Commander Mike Roberts, and a supportive sister, Christine Cupolo
Yes, I do
My brother is in Kuwait
My sister is a grammar school teacher in Clayton, North Carolina
And this is one of many deployments he's been on, but this one is probably the most crucial
So, I knew that, at one point or another, my children needed to write
I thought that would be a real uplifting experience for the troops
And she says: Dear brave friend

I would say: Dear, friend, I have some questions for you
I want to know about the dolphins that are helping you out over there
Can you do that
Do you think you could ask them a question
Sure
They will be happy to answer it
But I think this helps me stay closer to my brother
Any message to your sister
Yes
I'd just like to tell her, thank you very much, Christine
Hope you're doing well in North Carolina
Their second-grade work keeping watch over those who keep watch in the Persian Gulf

That's it for this hour
I'm Judy Woodruff in Washington
CNN's John Irvine has this profile of a city literally teetering on a razor's edge
Getting acquainted, very deliberately, the U.S. Marines are trying to strike up a rapport with the people who are now their responsibility
But there are still problems bringing control to Baghdad, particularly at nighttime
In the pitch black of a city without power, these soldiers manning a roadblock became nervous
Stay the backBack up
Bullets are sprayed everywhere
In parts of Baghdad that the Americans haven't yet reached, there has been looting
This man took the horse from a stable at the home of Uday Hussein, Saddam's eldest son
We found the house, a large, gaudy structure, a place that just a few days ago people didn't even look at for fear of their lives
This indeed was one of Uday's homes
Here, the ruling family could look out over the Tigris
People have wasted no time clearing the house and wrecking what couldn't be easily taken
They haven't quite worked out just how to reach this will chandelier yet
But, other than that, they have stripped this place bare in less than 24 hours
Call it plunder, if you will, or perhaps payback
These Iraqis were rifling a home of a senior member of the Mukhabarat, Saddam's dreaded secret police
It also seemed to be some kind of monitoring station
There was sophisticated equipment here
In the basement, we found burning archives and evidence of electronic surveillance
This had been a nerve center for spying, a place from where the bully boys kept tabs to keep control
We're now in the bowels of a secret police monitoring station
Look at all this gadgetry, quite sinister really, part of the apparatus of Big Brother
These people are stealing from a shopping center
It has become widespread, but it's not being done with total impunity
John Irvine, ITV News, Baghdad
Some pictures
Well, Laith Kubba is an Iraqi exile who has family members in Iraq
Mr. Kubba is a senior fellow at a think tank called the National Endowment for Democracy
He is also the president of a group of Iraqi exiles, a group called the Iraq National Group
He joins us now from London to talk about rebuilding his country
Mr. Kubba, first of all, your thoughts as you've watched these scenes of Baghdad, the Saddam Hussein regime falling in the last day
And, obviously, there are four million people who could have suffered more
So, there is a sigh of relief that it is not worse
But, obviously, there is a great, great concern about the scenes that you've been showing on television
Are you talking to family members now in Baghdad and around Iraq
And, if you are, how concerned are they about the lawlessness
Well, not in the recent three or four days
There are no phone lines to Baghdad
So those signs to me are worrying
People are sensing and feeling the lack of authority or the power vacuum and are testing it
And the more they test, the more I think they are claiming
How difficult will it be to sort out who will next hold power in Iraq after this transition period, however long it is, where the U.S. is in charge
Well, one needs to break down this process into various elements
Today, there should be an authority
And it's very likely that the U.S. and the British forces are the authority on land
And there ought to be administration
And this ought to be primarily by Iraqis
But when it comes to government, I think we really need to map out step by step how to move from this power vacuum to the day we have elections
We need to involve the U.N.
We need to involve all Iraqi forces in the country, outside the country
But we need to do it quickly, because every day passes by with this vacuum, it's going to spell trouble
Well, we know, Mr. Kubba, there are several Iraqi exiles groups competing for influence
Is one of them going to have an advantage
I think it's one thing to gain fame and access to Washington
It's totally another to gain legitimacy and functioning grounds inside Iraq
And I think plans must not be drawn in thin air out in Washington
It must really be drawn on the ground inside Iraq
And there are 22 million people there
It's not a void
It's not a vacuum
And I think all plans must be anchored there in Iraq in its reality
So does one group have an advantage over another now
There are different groups who have advantage over others in different parts of the country
Unfortunately, we do not have a national group that can appeal to Iraqis as Iraqis within a credible voice
But we do not have a single group, a single leadership or a single council yet
We're talking with Laith Kubba, who is the president of a group of Iraqi exiles
The group is called the Iraq National Group
Mr. Kubba, we thank you so much for talking to us from London
Thank you
We appreciate it
Thank you
Here in Washington, members of the House of Representatives come together to support America's armed forces
One of the toughest jobs in Iraq right now is that of the military doctor
Each of these bangs and explosions comes with a story
Some we'll never know
Nobody knows these stories better than the Devil Docs, Naval corpsmen who never look the other way, but rather face what needs to be done without flinching
They are often the first faces the injured see, be they Iraqi or coalition force members
The work of the Devil Docs is by no means over
The Navy has set up a helicopter landing zone just a 100 meters from a mobile operating room, just on the outskirts of Baghdad
This is the closest front line surgical company
It is there the doctors begin their work
The operations are on their hands, abdomen and face
Two of the Marines, too far gone
For many of the survivors, that news is the most difficult to handle
Along with the medical care, hands are held, spirits are lifted
Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN with the Devil Docs outside Baghdad
CNN's Ryan Chilcote reports the 101st Airborne 2nd Brigade finds 11 of what an Army general describes as chem-bio labs buried to avoid detection near Karbala, each of the structures 20-by- 20 feet
And the military also found over 1,000 pounds of documents buried at the site
U.S. inspections will continue there
Well, Baghdad is a city where drinking water and working telephones are hot commodities
Now, regular cell phones rarely work these days in the city, we're told, but satellite phones are another story entirely
CNN's Rula Amin reports from the Iraqi capital
They wait for hours to find a journalist and they plead with us to borrow our mobile satellite phones
They need to send a message to their families abroad just to tell them, We are alive, says this woman
Here, they wait outside a restaurant where journalists hang out
And they are desperate
Only for one minute, says this mother
It's not good for her to worry about us, she says
Across the fence, a 21-year-old U.S. Marine named Jason Cook is after the same phones
A New York Times reporter lends Cook his mobile sat phone
I love you too, mom
Hey, old man
I'm in the middle of Baghdad, just patrolling up and down the streets
Cook hasn't spoken to his family since Super Bowl Sunday, January 26
My mother, brother and sister
How many do you have
I got an older brother and a little brother and sister
His mother told him to keep his head down
She didn't believe I was really talking to her
We do our share
Nevertheless, the mother is happy
We couldn't accommodate everybody
Rula Amin, CNN, Baghdad
Makes you wish they had enough satellite phones to go around for everybody

Welcome back to LATE EDITION
We return now to my interview earlier today with the United States defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld
Well, I guess time will tell
He's, in my judgment, had a visit that was worth doing, and the president asked him to do it, and it was the right thing to do
We'll see what progress comes
You know, words are one thing, actions are another
I know what they've been doing, and it's been unhelpful
I know that Secretary Powell was just there and advised them that it was unhelpful, and gave them some pointers and some suggestions for the future
In my view, they were making some unwise decisions previously
What they'll do after this visit remains to be seen
Is there any movement in trying to determine the fate of these individuals
All right, tell me what
It also takes time to figure out what law enforcement process might be appropriate, and what Colin and I have been concerned about, both of us, is that it's taking so long
There are a number of countries, and the Department of State has the responsibility of dealing with those countries, that have foreign nationals in Gitmo, in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, being detained, and those countries, understandably, would like to know when they could have those people.So the inter-agency process takes a great deal of time
Colin and I are trying to speed up that process, and that's what that's all about
Let me just, a couple of nuggets to sort of wrap up before I let you go
Victory parades for the troops
I remember covering General Schwarzkopf, the parades in Washington and New York after the first Gulf War
There's no question but that the troops, the young men and women, did such a superb job that there has to be a way to honor them, and there will be
And General Franks and his team have done just a superb job for our country and for the world, and indeed for the Iraqi people, who have been liberated
What's the best way to do that
In this instance, it was a very different task
We still have to face the problem of a number of global terrorist networks and terrorist states that exist, that work with those global networks
And on the one hand we will, in fact, find a way to honor the courage and dedication and talent of these young men and women, and we'll do it well
Whether it will be modeled off the 1991 thing, I don't know
I kind of doubt it, because it's such a different circumstance
One final question on North Korea
If the North Koreans pursue their nuclear weapons ambitions
Yes
I'm not one who speculates about things like that
But those are very serious issues, and I leave them for the president
President Bush aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln on Thursday, formally declaring the successful accomplishment of the military mission in Iraq
Welcome back to LATE EDITION
Joining us now are two key members of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee
In his home state of Indiana, the committee's chairman, Republican Senator Richard Lugar
And here in Washington, Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut
Senators, welcome back to LATE EDITION
Mr. Chairman, let me begin with you
Are you among those who are beginning to conclude that, when all the dust settles, the U.S
may not find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq
No, I concur with Secretary Powell, Secretary Rumsfeld, the president, that weapons of mass destruction are there, and likewise, that we will be led to them by people knowledgeable in the country as to where they are
What form we may find them and what traces of destruction and all the rest of it will be very interesting and, likewise, the intellectual capital that is there to produce more
Because not much else is you don't need much to get it going again
And that, I think, we have to be working with these people who are in the business to make sure they don't re-enter the business, much as we did with Russian scientists under the Nunn-Lugar program
What about you, Senator Dodd, do you believe, in the end, they will find weapons of mass destruction
I have no evidence to the contrary
There's no doubt about that at all, both in Iran and against the Kurdish population
So, whether or not they find them in the exact form that many would assume they would be the case possibly some got out of the country
It wouldn't surprise me to hear that
But I'm going to work on the assumption, based on the intelligence that has been gathered, that the weapons of mass destruction existed
What if they don't
So, I wouldn't dwell on that point specifically, because Saddam Hussein clearly was a producer and a user of biological and chemical weapons
He clearly was on the track to acquire a nuclear capacity, and the world is a safer place today because he's not ruling Iraq
Will the U.S. lose creditability, Mr
Chairman, if, if the U.S
finds no hard evidence, no so-called smoking gun
No, we have full credibility in Iraq
We've prosecuted with the alliance a successful liberation of the Iraqi people, and we have clearly caused Saddam to destroy weapons of mass destruction, or at least to suppress evidence of them
That is a victory of sorts.This is a facet that's important
Senator Dodd, how important is it for the U.S. to conclusively learn what happened to Saddam Hussein
Well, it's important
But I don't think it's as important as finding Osama bin Laden, for the simple reason that I don't think Saddam Hussein today poses any threat, wherever he is
So, it would certainly be good to know where he is
And you agree with that assessment, Mr. Chairman
Yes, I think that Senator Dodd is right on
What about the length of the U.S. military presence in Iraq, Senator Lugar
How long do you anticipate large numbers of U.S. troops will remain there
Well, I was heartened by what Secretary Rumsfeld told you in the last interview, that we will have troops there as long as necessary, but no longer than necessary
I think that's a pretty good way to state it
My own view is that the security of the country clearly is our responsibility presently
We are trying to pass that on to others
Likewise, the other government's procedures, the fledgling beginnings on democracy, and all the rest
But that's going to require an undergirding
Now, in due course, as everybody points out, we may get help from other countries
We may bring in NATO allies or the United Nations or other people in the Arab world
That would be helpful
But for the moment, this is our responsibility
And we ought not to be having large debates about how rapidly we move out
And I was upset, in a way, to hear reports that by the fall, three divisions out of five would be gone
I think Secretary Rumsfeld disabused us of that today
And what about you, Senator Dodd, not only the length of time, but the cost to U.S
taxpayers
Have you been given any ballpark estimate what this is going to cost the United States
No
Well, what we've heard the numbers of reconstruction running around $100 billion
We put $2.5 billion in, in the last supplemental appropriations bill
So it's going to be costly
These RFPs, these seeking bids on various contracts are rather costly, and so it's going to be expensive
And clearly the responsibility is going to fall principally on the United States
And to the extent we can move that along more quickly, I think we're all going to be better off
Being the sole, or almost the sole power there, both in terms of reconstruction and politically, exposes us to great vulnerabilities
Senator Lugar, we have to take a quick break, but before we do, I wanted to just ask you, the U.N. role you say there could be a U.N. role
Do you specifically want the United Nations to have some sort of peacekeeping role there
No, I don't want anybody shut out
And I do hope the United Nations will play a vital role in Iraq, whether it be in peacekeeping or various other ways, and I hope that that will occur soon
I think we really need an internationalization of the process, for the very reasons that Senator Dodd pointed out
All right
We're going to take that quick break
Stand by, Senators
We have a lot more ground to cover
Senators Lugar and Dodd will be staying with us
LATE EDITION will continue right after this
i just want to update you on kofi annan's remarks
the u.n. secretary-general did not answer questions on iraq as a result
there's nothing to report on that front
we have just gotten word from the ninth circuit court of appeals that that court has now put on hold its ruling banning the pledge of allegiance in public classrooms
schools in nine western states would have been prohibited from having students say the pledge starting monday
the appeals court ruled last summer, but the phrase under god which was ad ded to the pledge in the 1950s is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion
here's how you're weighing in on our web question of the day
remember when we've been asking you this question
who is the number one threat facing the u.s
is it saddam hussein, kim jong il or osama bin laden
look at the results
13%% of you say saddam hussein
14% of you who voted say kim jong il, 41% say osama bin laden
remember, this is not, not a 13, 46, 4 1, those are the numbers
you see them, 13% for saddam hussein, 46% for kim jong il, 41% for osama bin laden
remember this, ask not a scientific poll,
it's with wednesday, march 5 200 3
i'm wolf blitzer in washington
secretary of state colin powell acted like a prosecutor, pointing out iraq's failures
even the vatican voiced concerns today
welcome back
25 minutes after the hour
time for the cafferty file
good morning
a crazy world we live in
the supreme court of the united states upheld the toughest three strikes law in the country yesterday
that's california's
the voters overwhelmingly passed the law in 1994 to offset the liberal and lenient judges to let bad people off with nothing more than a slap of the wrist
one-third of them not that
300 of them are in there for things like petty theft
25 other states that have the three strikes law
and that brings us to the question
it was a close vote
5-4 in the supreme court
here is the question of the day
that is the
record temperatures in the north
threatening right now to freeze over lake superior surface
if so, forecasters say it will be the first time there in about two decades
lake superior, the largest of the five great lakes
it doesn't look too frozen there
all this happening about 90 minutes ago based on the wire reports we're getting here
the morning papers, because morning papers around the country and around the world are remaking their front page to include the elizabeth smart case, and we end with that tonight
with her family on a day when their miracle finally came true
she looks very, very healthy
she's grown a lot
and i'm just so absolutely thrilled
i couldn't believe it
in fact, i had to take a double take and pull her back away from me and say, is it really you? all of the children out there deserve to come home to their parents the way the way elizabeth has come back to us
and we need to have this here
we really do
but i just am so grateful and so thankful
thank you very much
can you describe elizabeth's demeanor
you said she looked good, she was bigger, but she's been through this horrible ordeal
is she still scared
she excited
happy
i don't know
i mean, it was just i'm sure she was just thrilled to be back
i just such happiness and such love
and i just held her, held her the whole way home
do miracles still exist
and the answer is yes
and we have elizabeth back
this neighborhood, the federal heights neighborhood, everybody's been ripped up, everybody's helped, everybody's prayed to do whatever they can
we thank god for all the searchers, for all the people
in the history of the world i don't think a little girl's been prayed for more than elizabeth smart
and we thank you for answering those prayers
thank you
it's a nice day to have this job
we'll see you tomorrow, 10:00 eastern time
captions by vitac www.vitac.com a ceo is about to announce employee of the year
earlier, several go-getters prepared to accept their award
and when i began this journey when i started this journey me
i had no idea i'd
that her younger sister, mary katherine, was the one who went to her father and said, dad, i think i know who did this
but it took some four months before they were able to get a picture and identify the picture as this brian david mitchell and then his wife, wanda barzee
the other questions, of course, are why didn't elizabeth smart try to escae
were there opportunities perhaps that she might ab vible to able to get away from her abductors
the police are saying she was abducted by knife point and was an opportunity and may have been some kind of fear factor going on
we are seeing a lot locally here some photographs that are coming out that show the three, that show mitchell, his wife, and who they believe to be elizabeth smart at a party in september
there were times perhaps they were in a park somewhere in salt lake city completely robed in these veiled and robes so you could not see her face
there are a lot of questions coming out about why she could not get away from them, that remains to be answered
the police are going to be holding a press conference later today
we're hoping to get more details about that
you've heard the old saying, the best offense is a good defense
what does this mean if you're traveling you might ask
to cnn's patty davis at reagan national airport
what are travelers to do and, for that matter, not to do
miles, what that means is tighter security at airports across the country
and that could potentially slow you down
some things you may want to do is, first all, just get here a little bit early
now, homeland security chief tom ridge described some of those new security measures on top of the ones that are already in place
begin the training for the pilots in the cockpits with firearms
then you've got the hardened cockpit doors
you have training for the flight attendants
you have more federal air marshals
you come outside the airline the airplane itself and you have technology, 100% inspection of baggage
you have new trained inspectors for passengers
you enhance airport security outside the perimeter
airports are currently
we are watching activity in baghdad
thank you very much
a lot of bridges between where the 3 7 cavalry and the rest of the u.s
forces are now and their ultimate destination, downtown baghdad
we have the city laid out for you here
how many bridges in this city alone
in this map we have right here, 13 major bridges in downtown baghdad, including the expressway bridge over here
three bridges here attaching east baghdad to west baghdad and the palace area
this is one technique, one possible way u.s
forces might seize a bridge, a bridge that might be defended by iraqis
let's look at the animation
typical scenario there
it doesn't really matter for this scenario that we're laying out here
you have to bundle up and line up to go across that bridge
potentially chemical weapons, too
as we turn the other direction, what you'll see are these iraqi tanks that are kind of fortified there
they have burns in front of them
and then they there goes the smoke screen
it doesn't work, though
it works both ways
it obscures you but also obscures them
here's an f-16
he comes in and wants to identify his target and he's got a big
can't see through the smoke
we've got some techniques we're going to show you
somewhere near we can put down special
on we go in the meantime
yesterday the story centered on intelligence regarding enemy intentions
today the evidence is somewhat more tangible
reporting for us, cnn's david ensor
gas masks turning up in abandoned trenches
in nasiriyah in a building marked as a hospital u.s
marines found weapons, atropine antidote kits, and that was not all
they found over 3,000 chemical suits and gas masks as well as a number of iraqi military uniforms
there is also intelligence, officials say, suggesting republican guard units have been issued artillery shells containing chemical agents
in baghdad deputy prime minister tariq aziz repeated his government's stand it does not have any kind of weapons of mass destruction
when they started to talk about the weapons of mass destruction, we know and we always knew that that was fabrication and lines
but as our candy crowley reminds us, life does and must go on
spring-time and a game of catch on the washington mall
a gentle breeze and a good meal beside the pacific ocean
that other place, the one on tv all the time, might as well be on another planet
and that may be the point
we happen to be at a very nice spot by the beach where this is a chance for people to get away from cnn coverage, everything, and kind of relax
time to redefine normal again, which on the homefront now seems to mean life as you live it only weirder
i'm amazed at how unaffected i am by things, how i'm still coming to work and doing the same things and going for a walk in the morning
and it just seems so strange to me that it's almost a parallel universe
the barber at hinsville georgia larries that
they seem more depressed
a lot of them afraid they're going to lose their jobs, you know, the economy is down and all kind of stuff
life on the homefront seems the same at farmer's market in los angeles, but it's more angst ridden
i don't think it's affecting our business as much as i was worried that it would, but you never know it's going to happen
nationwide, people shopped less in the first week of the war
sales fell 2 percent from the previous week
my boyfriend has been watching the tv like every single day, every time it comes on, he's watching it
maybe fewer people are shoning because they're watching tv
there's no one economic statistics to point to a downturn, it's an overall feeling, a psychological feeling that everything is frozen, everything is on hold
consumers aren't spending, people aren't buying stock, everything is
cnn's jamie kolbe is there reporting, jamie on these families who are saying good-bye to their loved ones
their equipment that left on january is now on a ship on its way south through the suez canal and it's interesting to note some of the equipment that's been held up for the last couple of months, there are some 5 helicopters, 200 tanks as well as 150 bradley infantry fighting vehicles
these are highly trained soldiers
they are ready to go
their mission is very broad, judy to deploy anywhere in the world in support of national strategy
they doan know what they'll be doing
they will learn that once they get there their first stop will be to central command, they'll receive more specific orders
they will be join by the first cavalry
they have received deployment orders
they have not yet been told to make final arrangements
they are ready
they are determined and they are very patriotic in support of our country
judy
it's i don't think we can say it often enough, jamie
it's got
today's battles include pictures of the oil field fires in southern iraq
firefighters continue their work at the ramallah oil field
officials say they capped one blaze, leaving only two wells still burning out of 500 oil fields in the area
aless so vinci is there with the marines
the company which lost nearly $4 billion over the past two years has cut its annual costs by nearly $2 billion
most of that was saved by cutting employee wages and benefits
the dow is down
you see there, just about almost 140 points
nasdaq down 20 and the s&p is down, as well
so the markets are continuing their negative trend from last week
we'll keep our i on that
is it a taste of more to come in iraq
now a spokesman from the central command is saying and i'm quoting frankly, we have bigger and more important things to do
during a live broadcast geraldo drew a map in the sand showing the location of the unit in relation to baghdad
you know, they can't compete fair and square on the battlefield so they're trying to stab me in the back
it is not first time
we showed you the statements yesterday
today he appeared on on nbc's today show and said he was sorry
i want to apologize to the american people for clearly making a misjudgment over the weekend by giving an interview to iraqi television
but clearly by giving that interview to iraqi television, i created a firestorm in the united states
and for that i am truly sorry
but the question remains did peter arnett and geraldo rivera cross the line
or were they within their rights as reporters
we posed that question to michael wolf, a contributing editor for new york magazine, a media columnist, an important article in the new issue of new york
he's joining us now live from qatar
what do you say to the question, michael
well, you know, i think i'm
president bush said yesterday the threat of domestic terrorism remains high
they're wrong
what still needs to be done to keep americans safe at home, steven berle tacks that issue in after how america confronted the september 12th era
congratulations
thank you
what comes out yesterday, on two best-sellers list
so far, so good
you've spent over a year investigating the subject
you had unprecedented access not only to secretary ridge but the attorney general and other player in this post-september 11th environment
how vulnerable do we continue to be
well, quite vulnerable in some places and yet we've made great strides
the access i had was not only at top but the people who were on the front lines
and this is really the behind the scenes story of everything they had been doing to make this country safer
i think we decided on the morning of september 12th we're not going to be victim, we're not just going to sit there
we're going to try to do something
in the ports, at the airports, even with our food supply, we have taken all kinds of steps
but we are vulnerable
we're vulnerable right out on the streets here
we're vulnerable in mass transit systems because we can't involve this problem infin any lu we've made good strides in the last we're
that's the story i try to to tell about the men and women who have brought us this point
can the
the hijacker got off the plane wearing a jacket that said, america across the back
and a small child clinging to his leg
coalition field commanders say u.s. troops are now within 15 miles of the iraqi capital
u.s. troops could be in baghdad southern outskirts by early thursday
for the second straight day, iraqi television meanwhile has broadcast a statement from the iraqi president saddam hussein
however, despite the appearance of saddam hussein in and what was said to be new fattage, the statement itself was read by an iraqi news anchor wearing a military uniform
iraqi forces are overwhelmed and could soon collapse
what a brave young woman
she was captured but she was one tough cookie, apparently
god bless here
and she's going to be all right, it looks like
we have some other items, voices of america they're called her on american morning
we begin in oklahoma, a story of sacrifice in wartime
alexis jane denise, but without her husband
john scottsdale is on the front lines in iraq
i don't know what to do
his parents have stepped in to help with their new granddaughter and it looks as though mother and daughter are doing well
voices of america on a morning where it looks like things gring well for the coalition members
did you hear the family members of jessica lynch yesterday
they said it was a miraculous thing
they've tried these things before, but never with the success
i guess miracle isn't too strong a word
it's a great word
when you heard her father talk
welcome jeffrey to be in
he thought it
all right
just about 25 minutes long in that press conference there at nato headquarters in brussels
he mentioned a headline a short time ago
colin powell saying an end will come soon and toward the end, this regime will be finished
also a question there about the united nations
a question about nato about what role these two organizations may play in rebuilding iraq
colin powell says the u.n
does have a role to play, what role that is remains to be seen
there was also one other moment there when you heard a woman asking about the safety of her husband right now
we have heard that perhaps both are being held in basra, possibly in a hospital, but there's no way for us to confirm their whereabouts, but obviously a lot of concern from this woman as to where whereabouts of her husband and his health
walt rogers is back with us
we've been in and out now for almost two hours
what's happening with you and the 7th cav as we continue to watch your image by way of video phone and the giant m1-a1 tank
walt, good evening again
if we may again going to the wide screen of what appears to me to be abu dhabi television that is providing this picture, 3:20 a.m
in baghdad, live pictures again
again, correspondents, our correspondents with the embedded with these forces, with them in the field, saying in some cases they can see the lights of the skyline of baghdad
as you know, the republican guard just outside baghdad to defend the city and saddam hussein's regime, in principal
the so-called medina division, and the baghdad division
the baghdad division, of course, getting its name from the fact that it is the republican guard division designated to defend principally baghdad
so we are seeing a lot of what some of the military officials are calling a method that does not seem to be directed by one person from the center of baghdad
we will continue to monitor that
tim hewart of itn reports
the pentagon says the strategy is to seize key objectives in and around baghdad
coalition aircraft were heard flying overhead
it's not clear what the targets are
certainly, some of them near and around saddam hussein international airport although there have been strikes in central baghdad as well
in the course of the past hour
the 3rd infantry is approaching from the southwest, the 1st marines from the southeast
iraqi forces using soviet-era tanks
they stand no chance against the m1 abrams tanks used by army and marines
central command has determined that baghdad airport is unusable for normal air operations
the airport, for the most part, is now under u.s. control
military officials will not say whether damage to the runways is going to limit operation there, but they know there are underground bunkers there and some other areas that may be of use
centcom also says 2500 republican guard troops have surrendered to u.s. marines between kut and baghdad
military officials say the baghdad republican guard division is no longer an effective fighting force
we turn now to an iraqi first of all, before we tell you about this story, we were going to, these are live pictures from baghdad
there's been some activity in the last few moments
you can see it there just now
we've been reporting, the city has begun to see its electricity turned back on
we don't know that all ofist is back, but at least some of it is
but the coalition is quick to point out that they do not have control of the area immediately surrounding the airport
again, this is these are live pictures of baghdad, where it is well into the night
we're, of course, going to keep monitoring the situation there and bring you up to speed on anything we learn
looking at like pictures of heirs force one now on the ground at a royal air force base outside of belfast, northern ireland
it's called aldergrove, just outside belfast
they'll also have an opportunity to review the so-called road map for israeli/palestinian peace negotiations to get off the ground
they also want to review what the status is of northern ireland right now as that peace process seems to be taking hold
been relatively quiet in northern ireland over the past few years
go forward as close allies in trying to help put together a new iraq
there are some significant differences in their strategy, including what role precisely the united nations should have in determining the future of iraq
they'll try to thrash all of that out
you're look at the picture of air force one taxiing in on the tarmac, getting ready for the president
seems pretty far away from belfast right now, general
but decisions that these two leaders make could have a significant impact on the future of iraq
first of all, general, we'll keep this picture up of air force one, talk about what you sense is happening on the streets of baghdad right now
wolf, it's clearly the final phase
the engame which is unfoaling right now
i think it's very significant not only in baghdad but basra itself
you have coalition forces there in some strength
apparently three ba talians of the u.s. 3rd division in baghdad three coalition assets, three huge battle groups in basra itself which the u.k
has there, what they've developed here, wolf, over the last several weeks i very clear and increasingly clear intelligence as to what the final remnants of the regime leadership are in terms of where they are embedded in the cities
but the more important presence is to go after what intelligence delivers and that's where these key leaders are located
this is a very important final phase here, wolf, and it looks like the closure is coming here now more rapidly than we anticipated
as we continue to watch air force one, now on the ground outside belfast, northern ireland, we'll be watching president bush emerge from the plane momentarily
we'll continue to have live coverage of that
when walter rodgers, our embedded reporter with the 3-7th cavalry says three battalions of troops are on the ground, inside baghdad itself, have taken up positions they're going to spend the night there presumably, how many soldiers are we talking about right now
between 700 and 1,000
the task forces really, wolf are probably built around the m-2 bradley the basic infantry fighting vehicle
it is the equipment of choice for a task force like this to go into baghdad
it's a very, very important piece of equipment
these are probably mechanized heavy task forces that have overhead aerial platforms to provide direct support
it's significant the degradation of the iraqi air defenses has allowed a-10s, predators, u-s, other assets to hover and loiter and provide the overhead protection to these task
welcome back n case you're just tuning in, our top story this hour, the discovery of suspect chemical weapons materials at an agricultural complex in central iraq
initial tests were inconclusive
the general benjamin frankly of the 101st says today a more sophisticated test indicated the presence of nerve and blister agents
he says that type of test that is required sometimes shows false-positives and further testing will be done to determine whether the materials are indeed nonweaponized chemical agents or perhaps simply pesticides
general frankly says it is hard to believe u.n
inspectors would have found the facility hidden as deeply as it was near the euphrates river
we'll are much more on this developing story coming up in a few minutes
what's happening there tonight, gary
well, wolf, the air force is continuing its 24-hour air coverage over baghdad
there will always be multiple warplanes, fighter
we're going to pause for a second to see if we see the president hopping off this chopper
as you probably know, the prime minister of the great britain has been under great pressure at home and much of europe to support giving the united nations a very strong role in stabilizing iraq
the white house had signaled consistently it wants the united states and great britain to create a lead role
we learned from john king, traveling with the president, that the new iraq run neither by u.s./british coalition or united nations, but by the iraqi people
the president went on to say that an interim authority composed of iraq grs inside and outside the country will run iraq until a permanent government can be established
do you want to hang with the shot
okay, we're going to stay with this shot
they really wanted to let folks who had any concerns about what the u.n
involvement might be to not worry
they said there will definitely be some kind of role for the united nations, they think it's very important for the european nations to be on board with the plan, but once again, they very much view the future of iraq as being that in iraqi hands
the president greeting a number of dignitaries as he gets ready here to board air force one on his way home
a little earlier this morning, i spoke with an iraqi dissident who teaches at writes extensively on the middle east
he wrote a book called the republic of fear
the politics of modern iraq
hamburg, germany
it happened near the baghdad airport which is in u.s. hands
pilot said they're doing well
all right
they found it at an industrial complex
material has been haiftly abandon
these figures come to us from abu dhabi television
they cannot be verified by cnn
the iraqi government has not released the information or military casualties at all
5:33 a.m., martin savidge says the marines have found chemical protection suits and antidotes for chemical weapons in a field beside an industrial complex in southeast baghdad
nearby they found abandoned weapons and artillery case, which they demolished
the pilot ejected and was rescued
an air force pilot is back at his base after a close call
cnn's gary tuchman is live near the iraqi border with details on the mission and the pilot's rescue
gary
wolf, hello to you
it was a very tense and nerve-racking day for the pilot who is stationed at this base near the iraqi border
took it out early this morning
here's what happened to him
he realized the plane was going to crash so he ejected
all these planes have ejection seats
the pilots carry parachutes
he is in good condition with the 172nd fire squadron which is based in battle creek, michigan
but he's a very lucky man
he's with two other a-10s flying along with him
one came back to the base
the other we have a picture of
it landed at a base controlled by the coalition
the pilot also was able to make a safe landing and neither of those pilots were hurt
we have video of that plane
that plane has a role in one of the engines
stabilizer in the back of the plane
the pilot lost all flight control as she was flying back

now that saddam hussein's regime has fallen is democracy the answer to iraq and its people
in his book, fareed zakar ericks a joins us now to talk about democracy and iraq's future
good to see you
thank you, paula
good to see you on a different network for a change
that's what happens when you sell books
i know
let's talk about what barbara starr was reporting from the pentagon
she says there is an acknowledgment from those officials that there are not enough ground troops in place and particularly in baghdad to control what our nic robertson is saying is a stage of anarchy in some parts of iraq
do you think the administration underestimated the day after
i think because the day after came so fast and so suddenly in way
i think that there's been a pattern here not just with this administration, but over the last ten years, bosnia, kosovo, afghanistan, where we don't quite recognize when the old order collapses, you very quickly have to rush in and fill it with some kind of new order
in the short-term, that's going to have to mean the american military
but the key question, which i try to address in the book, is what do you do after that
what kind of authority do you create in a society going through this kind of transition
and how do you know that the local iraqi citizens will make up this government or, in fact, interested in democracy
there's no proof of that
well, the key here is the only way to get that kind of legitimate government to have it look good is to hold elections
but if you hold elections, you stop the whole process of building a rule of law, creating courts, creating administration
there is this tension here which is the only way to make this look good is in some way get legitimate iraqi authority, but the faster you get that, the more likely you stop this process
so what do you think of this interim government
you got deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz saying that american and british military forces would play a leading role in setting up an iraqi government and then later draw civilians into the process
is that going to work
i think it will work if it's truly broad-based and truly consensual, try and include all different people and including them in creating a constitution which would take a few years
what i point out is the plays where you've had quick transitions
a michigan teen who disappeared with a convicted killer and went on a three-week oddysey is in trouble with the law tonight
police caught up with the two in california
we try to bring you the work of still photographers who are applying their trade in iraq these days

it's like my life
we recognized them because of their uniform
very close to the u.s. marines uniform
i didn't see fear in their eyes
it was an american tank that had techmy call problems
they really believed on the tank
i was taking pictures
the reporter was with me
wanted to go in
i said, no
while
in were also big celebrations at ft
hood, texas, home base to two other p.o.w.s, david williams and ronald young
today, their families are learning new and actually harrowing details about the days after their capture
cnn national correspondent susan candiotti is with the young family in georgia, jamie cole by at ft
hood, texas, where she spoke to williams' wife michelle
susan, why don't we start with you
hello, judy
however, the family did get in a company of questions about how he was treated
they learned he lost 20 pound pounds and also their son told them that in the last few days of his capture, things weren't so bad but that they were very rough in the beginning
their son is said to be in very good spirits now and back here in georgia, after three weeks of not knowing exactly what had happened to him, finally, for the very first time in three weeks, the young family members got some sleep last night for the first time in a long time
well, at least some family members did
she slept pretty good
i'm not kidding
all right
i got in there, laid downer she must have took a pill or something
sounded like a saw mill going on next to me
back on the couch again
hey, i was tired
and besides, it was relief, you know
i could finally sleep and know everything was okay
of course, pictures and videotape and a phone call is one thing
but seeing their son in person is quite another
and they are, of course, hoping that will happen very soon
back to you, judy
at least, we would think, if that's the case
thanks very much
let's turn to jamie at ft
hood, texas, where she's been talking with the family of chief warrant officer david williams
for them, jamie, begin what we just heard about the knife at his throat, they must be incredibly relieved
you know, judy, they have been learning more and more as the day goes on
the focus is clearly not on their treatment or their capture but their freedom
for three weeks she's watched and waited for some news
the only other pictures was his abandoned helicopter
she knew instantly when she saw it, because of the 1st cavalry emblem and special markings it was his
it's been a long three weeks
today is date she was waiting for
ihood a chance to spend some time with her yesterday
this morning on american morning she told us about what her reaction was when she saw those first pictures of her husband free
i was so happy
he i knew i never lost hope that he was alive and just seeing him and being able to see his eyes and his reaction to his rescue just took a huge load off my shoulders
incredible support from military spouses, but this is a true love story
they have been at ft
hood for a short time

we begin we will finish
the extra $400 per child to american families this year, 2003
all together these tax reductions will help 92 million americans
and a significant part of the benefit to our economy will come within the first two years of the plan
a family of four with an income of $40,000 would receive a 96% reduction in federal income taxes
instead of paying $1,178 per year, the family would pay $45 a year
that means extra money in the family budget year after year
that money can cover a lot of bills
that money can help families with purchases they have been delaying
that money will be in circulation, which will be good for our economy
and this plan will help our small business sector
the benefits of the growth plan will come from uncreased consumer spending and, as importantly, from a lower income tax rates on the small businesses themselves
it is important for our fellow citizens to understand that most small businesses pay their business taxes at the individual rates
most small businesses are sole proprietorships, limited partnerships, are subchapter ss, and, therefore, when you reduce individual tax rates, you benefit small business formation
as a matter of fact, under this plan, some 23 million small business owners will see their taxes cut
which leaves more money for investment, more money for growth, more money for job creation
a growing economy also needs small business investment
and our tax code should encourage investment
today a small business can deduct a maximum of $25,000 in the year in which they buy equipment
we need to triple the amount that can be deducted in the year in which they buy equipment
so i propose to congress that they ought to limit limit ought to be increased to $75,000 and that limit ought to be indexed to inflation
by doing so, we promote greater investment in machinery
and when a small business bias machine that enhances their company's product divty as well as it means machinery manufacturer is likely to have more work available
more investment equals jobs
and what we are interested in in this administration is helping people who look for work find a job
we can also promote economic growth and job creation by removing the double tax on dividends
taxing corporate income once is fair
it is not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice
the burden of double taxation falls on the millions of individuals who receive dividends
falls especially hard on seniors who receive half of all dividend income
removal of double taxation would put more money in the hands of investors
it would encourage more investment in american businesses
economists say that this plan will help our stock markets, and since half of american families own stock, the reform will help them save and help our economy grow
now, these measures were presented to congress in the first week of this year
the pro growth package was urgent in january
it's even more urgent today
it is important for you all to understand and for our fellow americans to understand the tax relief that i have proposed and will push for until enacted would create will create 1.4 million new jobs by the end of 2004
which has caused our government to run a deficit
the best way to reduce the deficit is with more growth in our economy, which means more revenues to our treasury, and less spending in washington, d.c.
i am pleased that both the house and senate have passed budget resolutions that show real spending restraint
and now the congress must focus on a robust and effective growth package
we need at least $550 billion in that package because the more tax relief that goes to the american people, the more jobs we will create in this economy
the last few months have been a time of challenge for america
our resolve has been tested
yet we have the great resources of national strength
and national character
to overcome every challenge we face
our confidence an our optimism have never waivered
we are defending the peace of the world
we're bringing freedom to corners of the world who haven't seen freedom in years
we're all building the prosperity of our country
this is a unique moment in our history and the american people are rising to meet it
i want to thank each of you for your hard work
i want to thank each of you for the faith you have shown in this country's future
may god bless you, and may god continue to bless america

national security correspondent david ensor joins us live from washington
david
peterson disappeared on christmas eve of last year
paul vercammen joins me now from martinez, california, with the latest for us
paul
well, lou, one thing that the coroner has been able to determine is that the skeletal remains are those of one, an adult female, and two, the remains of the almost full-term baby boy
and of course, this is significant because laci peterson, when she disappeared from her modesto home, was 7 1/2 months pregnant
that was on christmas eve
her husband, scott, at the time said that he was fishing in the berkeley marina
now, in a strange twist in all of this, just yesterday separate from the skeletal remains i alluded to earlier a man hiking near the berkeley marina found a bone, and they are now looking at that as another possible lead in this case
this person came across the bone at the shore
he brought it home and contacted the authorities, and we took possession of it
and you're trying to connect it to the other
well, we're trying to find out if it's a human bone and whether or not it is related to the others
and yet another reason why that bone could be a key link, there are reports that have surfaced that in terms of the female remains that were found the skeleton was not completely intact
now this case is also taking on a rather, we should say, almost a tv episodic forensic pathology angle because they're going to bring in an expert on what's called alufating decay, and basically this person is going to come in here and look at the body
this is in the damage aspect of it
we may learn a lot more on this in just 15 minutes
reporting live from martinez, california, i'm paul vercammen, now back to you
paul, let me ask you, if i may, quickly, are we expecting is there any reason for us to expect that there would be the ability to identify those remains as a result of these autopsies this afternoon
it sounds like all of this will be too quick, and it seems underlying all this is there could be an absence of dental records
that's particularly important for the adult female remains
so now they're going to have to turn to dna, and that's why they're calling in these experts
some dna testing can be very quick, but sometimes it can take up to weeks, even more, lou
okay
paul vercammen, thank you very much
as paul just reported, the modesto, california police department will be holding a news conference just a few minutes from now, and cnn of course will be carrying that news conference live

cnn has exclusively obtained the united nations english translations of her arabic work papers
her research was conducted here at a location well-known to u.n. arms inspectors
300 miles west of baghdad
her notes begin with the test objective
her written words are read by a narateor
a field experiment was conducted to disperse biological agents, botulinum toxin and spors of bacillus
the tests were a success
taha then described the success of their tests using an anthrax sim lant and artillery rockets
dr. taha's notes do not tell us how far she eventually progressed in her biological weapons testing
that's why the marines came knocking
looking for her papers and looking for her

the area around mosul described as uncertain in terms of its stability with deliberate agitation
those are the words there that general brooks used a short time ago
also, news about another half-broth of saddam hussein apparently now apprehended overnight in baghdad with the i assistance of local iraqis
not sure where in baghdad, personal the person western neighborhood of mansour
we'll go through all of this throughout the morning here
first, to the pentagon and barbara starr to pick up what's happening
power being restored on a rolling basis throughout baghdad today
the city went dark two weeks ago leaving people without electricity or the ability to cook or keep food from spoiling

again, all this is an outstanding issue right now
in the north, you're going to hear a lot about the shallow graves today
at least 1500, maybe 1600 graves located in the north
jane arraf has made her way to that location and we heard her first live report about an hour ago and we will talk with jane again
we know that, quote, work will be done with the iraqis and that work will come, we are told, in the coming days

iraqi museum workers are starting to assess the damage to iraq's history
up to 20 loot the artifacts have been returned after religious clerics called for the action
now officials in the worldwide museum community have pledged their help in restoring iraq's past
liz george explains
iraq's history, iraq's culture
it's all demolished
a cry from the heart from one of iraq's archaeologists
a cry echoing around the world
it's a catastrophe
it's a catastrophe for the people of iraq, it's a catastrophe for the whole world, because the civilization of ancient iraq was the first urban civilization in the world
the british museum is home to the largest mesopotamia collection outside iraq, including some of the earliest forms of writing
it's the duty of international community to restore as much as possible to the museum and then, i think, the international community must organize itself to help the iraqi colleagues restore what is left
the british museum is putting six conserve tors and three curators into this as soon as it's possible
they'll go to work with the iraqi colleagues as

that's part of the system
and annual meeting, every year, i went they complained about executive salaries, even though the team that i managed increase shareholder value to $600 billion that sharoners received, the larger share orns being employees
i think it's really a question of degree, i mean, i think that ceos should make millions of dollars running companies, there are tens of thousand employees, billions of dollars of revenue
a million dollars is okay, maybe 5 million, $100 million to me that is too much money

and 2001, we passed what's called the no child left behind legislation
i love tha phrase, because it's a commitment of our nation to make sure that not only does every child excel, but no child gets left behind
members of both parties, both republicans and democrats came together to pass this law inherent in the law is the vision of high standards
and money to meet the standards
an historic reforms
all of which put the education decisions of america in the hands of teachers and principals and local officials
but we also said that as we seek excellence for every child, we must design accountability systems at the state level to determine whether or not each child is learning
in order to make sure no child gets left behind, we must understand whether or not each child is learning to read and write and add and subtract
if there are, there will be plenty of praise
if not, we will work to design programs to make sure no child gets left behind
that's the crux of the law
every state met the laws january 31st deadline for submitting their accountability plans for approval
i'm pleased to announce that secretary page has approved plans from arkansas, missouri and washington state
which bring the which bring the total number of approved plans to 16 covering 16 million children in public schools across america
secretary page and his department will continue working with the rest of the states to get the plans approved as quickly as possible
people are responding to the challenge at the local level
people are beginning to develop the accountability systems to show your states and your communities that you're doing your job
leaving no doubt in the minds of the parents and taxpayers and citizens, some of whom praise public schools, some are critical of public schools, that you're performing
they will understand why you're here being honored in washington, d.c. as one of the top 54 teachers around our country
education reform depends on good laws and good plans but you and i know it ultimately depends on good teachers
last june states submitted to the department of education strategies for ensuring that all teachers are highly qualified
by this september, states will assess the programs they expect to make by 2005 and 2006 school year
the department is working with states to help teachers meet new definitions of teacher quality, so that every classroom will have a well-trained highly effective teacher like you all
our 2003 national teacher of the year is an example of the highest professional standards
and the finest personal qualities
betsy rogers teaches first and second grade students and leads alabama
she is an accomplished teacher with 22 years in the profession

hello from washington
i'm wolf blitzer reporting
we are following several major developments right now
right now we're also waiting to hear from the president at the white house
we'll bring you his comments as soon as we get them and we'll get to all of that shortly, but first
a move by the president today designed to save children's lives and among his guests in the rose garden, elizabeth smart
here's cnn's justice correspondent kelli arena
she is joining us live
welcome back
check in with jack cafferty as we look at the fountains outside of time answer life
we were talking about the road map to middle east peace and ran a footage about the chicken and these dogs
there is the picture
the golden real estate treever on the left had a litter of pups and the chicken got in the pen, a real story, they're all hanging out
it looks as though the puppies in one of the shots is trying to get lunch from the chicken
that is what they're doing, jack
we got a lot of e-mails to us on the east coast who don't know about the farm
the answer is apparently, you can get
you cannot nurse a chicken
bill
there you go
the question should be what is the chicken getting out of this
i don't want to go there
i.k. in new jersey a buyology teacher, i can tell you without hesitation, a chicken cannot be nursed
only mammals that have distinct biological feature
chickens are also the void of hen's teeth, much to the satisfaction of those little puppies
you don't city people
no
our viewers are nice
not nasty
here is the explanation
this is the real deal
any farm kid knows that certain animals cannot see for a few days after they're born, including puppies
the puppies try to nurse the chicken hen
they do that by feel, not sight
a chicken hen is warm and comfortable, so they try their luck and eventually feel their way back to the mother dog where things work out better for them
i'm so glad that's cleared up
we'll get back to the

mayor farmer, can you give us the latest on your town
our founder here at cnn, ted turner, has sold more than half 0 his stake in aol time warner
that's a lot of shares and a lot of money
andy serwer's look into that and the mark muz
if you're investing, why now
chitchat in the time life building here at aol and all over wall street, ted turner selling 60 million shares for $800 million, more than half of his stake in the company, he opens 40 million plus now
question is, why
why is he selling
i think he's begin up
he's at least hedging his bets by keeping 40 million shares but basically he's decided that the company is not going wait he wants it to go and he's bailing out
you know, a lot of concern obviously by people who still own the stock
my point about this, if ted turner were so smart and he's a very smart guy but he did not sell at the top, okay
he didn't sell at $60
hind sight would have like to have gotten that
we'll look back five years from now, you can see, he has lost a lot of money
you know, he still had $1.7 billion, we're not shedding tears
he did have $8 billion
he's left a lot on the table
we'll look back five years from now and say, when the stock is either at $13 still or $8 or $30 and say, he was either very smart or not smart at all
he's still hedging his bet by keeping 40 million stake
i hope he's wrong
me, too
the question, i'm an aol shareholder sitting at home, hearing this news, done this set off a few alarms
will people panic and everybody sell it
i think the stock will be weaker today
again, you know, the stock has drifted below $10
it's been in the neighborhood for a while
i done see the thing going down a lot
the braves and thrashers
you really think
you know, i'm not sure
he loves apparently they're for sale
we'll have to see about that
thank you
thank you
let's check 4 with jack now
the question of the day, bill bennet
i figure if turner's smarter than i am, i'm selling my 80 shares
80 of them
$13 and change, out
talking about bill bennet this morning one of the country's leading crusaders for morality author of virtues and admits he has a gambling problem
me he made the admission after bennett lost up to $8 million in casinos in the last decade
the articles say he won at times that he had $200,000 lines of credit at several laying casinos
gambling, however, is not one of of of the vices bennett thinks is undermining american culture
we want to hear from viewers this morning
he does say he's going to stop
news of bill bennet's gambling changed your opinion of him
many, many responses
hypocrite would be a word present in many e-mails
hypocrite
barbara, bill bennet's glam gambling loss changed my opinion
linda write his can do what he wants with his money
i thought he was smarter than that
lawrence in missouri, after sitting in front of my tv night after night, listening to him, watching every perversion, sin and evil known to man or beast, being glamourized by sitcoms and tv talking heads, imagine my shock in hearing that bill bennet being soundly condemned for gambling, is this the beginning of a new morality
chad new york big deal
what have you done wrong this morning
i ain't telling, chad
david say my opinion did not change because of the new news
i always thought bennett was a louse
am@cnn.com is the address
unburden yourself
we'll talk more about it with jeff greenfield coming up
we'll continue to watch this cramma unfold off key largo in florida
let's much on to another important story
here's cnn's cly wallace
moments later, three journalists who were covering that israeli action appear
one with tv labeled on the back of a bullet-proof vest, another carrying a white flag
judging from the videotape, they appear difficult to see in the darkness
and difficult to hear
he is best known for his work on two award-winning documentaries which appeared on cnn exposing the world to the taliban rule in afghanistan
now the foreign press association in israel is calling for an independent investigation
so, again, to know exactly what happened we need a full-fledged inquiry
this is very worrying and i believe the israeli army should take special measures to prevent this
they have to realize that this is not a game going on there
soldiers are basically thinking about their own lives at that moment
they don't have time to hesitate
the israeli spokesman says the soldier his no choice, but to be there
journalists say
welcome to the second hour
good morning to you

we liberated the people of iraq from a brutal dictatorship
we brought greater security to people of all nations
both spain and the united states are committed to a stable, democratic and peaceful future for the people of iraq
spain has shown that commitment by sending engineering and medical units to help the people of iraq
and i thank you for that help
today, i have moved to ease sanctions imposed by the united states against iraq's old government
first based on the authority recently given to me by congress i'm suspending the iraq's sanctions act, which restricts the export of certain commitment necessary for iraq's reconstruction
secondly,'m directing the secretary to relax sanctions on american countries and citizens conducting business in iraq that contributed to humanitarian reconstruction
soon, at the u.n
security council, the united states, great britain and spain will introduce a new resolution to lift the sanctions imposed by the united nations
the regime that the sanctions were directed against no longer rules iraq
and no country in good conscience can support using sanctions to hold back the hopes of the iraqi people
today, the united states took steps to cut off financing for the organization because of its ties to the eta
we believe that the people of spain like everywhere have a right to live free from terror
we're committed to expanding trade which builds prosperity on both sides of the atlantic

we're determined to help build peace between the israelis and the palestinians
last week's confirmation of mazen permitted the road map for peace, developed with russia, the european union and the united states
spain and the united states are determined to take advantage of this moment of opportunity for peace

vanity fair's come lumist daniel fair is here
quiting in the june edition, he describes the journey
he said he found evidence that hussein's day of reckoning well over due
christopher hitchens joins us from california
good to have you with us
thanks for having me
give us your insights as to what you think the future holds
do you mean if i start with the past
not at you will
not at all i
not much of a trip
i wasn't up the sharp end
i wasn't taking risks
he was right about that
should have taken the side of the rebels then
helping the kurds, removing the regime
absolutely
we'd be 11 years into nation building by now if we'd done that
that seems to be the core of the argument
as you point out, of course, for the fact of the matter is, the mistakes of saddam hussein made possible his removal from power ultimately
the mistakes of the united states, again, as you point out, norman schwarzkopf making a peace, permitting helicopters to fly
still hurts me to read this
they say, okay, we have lost this round
do you mind if we keep your helicopters in the air just to be able to transport things
and he says, yeah, that's all right
they ask again, are you sure they mean that
they can't believe the luck
and it's not just been wise after the event, i believe, to say that there was an argument in realtime between the bush administration members
mr. cheney's the only one i know that changed his mind
most of those that took the view at that time, think until recently they were correct in saving saddam hussein
of course, mr. cheney was in the chain of command with swars cough and
many others
namely, the republican guard absolutely devastated
yes
and, well, we know now the harvest of all that
it hurts to think of how many wonderful people in iraq at the academic community, lawyers, human rights activists, civilians, intellectuals, people would now be alive
mistakes made then, mistakes part of human experience, but now we have an opportunity not to make mistakes
is it your sense that the united states is on the right track
that there is the prospect here a commitment here on the part of the united states to

leung, a prominent chinese-american, was practically the toast of l.a

kelli arena reports
the fbi's interest in this state park in maryland dates back to last december
officials got a tip back then that someone may have dumped equipment into one of the park's ponds
officials say they found the tip significant because the pond is about ten miles from fort dietrick where the army experimented with anthrax
agents searched the area at least four times since then
the mayor says the fbi is now considering draining one of the ponds
the police chief dine is in regular contact with the fbi
there are a number of facets to this investigation
it's very, very significant
according to government sources, agents in december found a large plastic enclosed container with large openings on the side
the fbi has said nothing publicly about anyone it may be investigating, but attorney general john ashcroft did refer publicly to steven hatfield, a former researcher as a person of interest
he's repeatedly proclaimed his innocence and the spokesman told cnn
investigators involved this case clearly frustrated
kelly, where does this investigation on hatfield stand
i mean, we have rather i can't think of another case like it
we've got rather public statements by law enforcement officials saying that he is the suspect that they think he's the guy athen we have denial and then we have this stuff
it's really really extraordinary
well, the attorney general has been the only person that has even mentioned steven hatfield's name publicly and he called him a person of interest
not a suspect

chris burns traveling with the president, he joins us from indianapolis
hi, chris
there's some shocking new information about the life of john f
kennedy, both before and during his days in the white house
the revelations are part of a just published biography about the 35th president
our jonathan karl takes a look inside the pages
the revelations about kennedy's alleged affair with an intern make up just a couple lines in historian robert dowd's 700-plus page biography
the information comes from a single source, an interview with a former kennedy staffer who says she does not remember the intern's last game
although he finds the reports of kennedy's womanizing credible, he believes new information about kennedy's health problems is more significant
jfk's public image was one of youthful vigor but in truth he battled serious medical problems his entire life
while researching his new book on jfk, dallic uncovered previously sealed medical records that detailed the ek tent of his medical troubles and the lengths he went to conceal them from the public
there are many stories about politicians who used political influence to get out of military conflict
in 1941, he flunked two military medical exams
his powerful father intervened, getting yet another exam
reading the report of his exam, one would think he never had a serious physical problem in his life
it was a complete whitewash that would never have been possible without his father's help
kennedy told a friend before he entered politics, you've got to live every day like it's your last day on earth
that's what i'm doing
jonathan karl, cnn, washington

judge james marin
thanks very much
why were you there so quickly
i wasn't really there that quickly
i actually responded a few hours after the sheriff's department did
the reason you went was
well, being the justice of the peace we are the ones that hold the inquest on the death and they were required to call us to the scene
what did you see when you got there
well, to be honest with you, i saw a pretty gruesome sight and i think it's been talked about quite a bit the last few days and if anybody didn't have to be there to see it, they were lucky not to have to be there
it was a horrific sight, you don't have to go into details, obviously, we can only imagine how bad it might have been
it probably was, indeed, based on your eyewitness accounts
what happened
they were collecting evidence as you were there, the law enforcement authorities
they had been collecting their evidence and, of course, when i got there they showed me the location and, of course, then having to do
several news organizations have filed for their reporters had with scott peterson
prosecutors are required to notify anyone if their phone conversations may be used as evidence
peterson's phones were tapped under a court order
earlier we talk about a new book claiming that president john kennedy had an affair with a white house intern early 1960s
a kennedy biographer robert dallek came across the story while doing research
the woman's name has remain a mystery
the 60-year-old tells the new york daily news and others dpa she is glad to have the weight she's been carrying for 41 years now off her shoulders
she says she was 19 at the time, working in d.c
at the white house, 1962, 1963, she says today the allegations about her affair are the truth
this news breaking just today
robert dallek tried to do the research to track this woman down in the book, it did not happen but now she has indeed come forward
in today's daily news, a 60-year-old woman acknowledges she was the 19-year-old white house intern who slept with jfk
she told the papers, i am the mimi
i want to take this opportunity to stand behind the mimi and proclaim my solidarity
i know where you've been because i too have been there myself
that's right, i too slept with jfk
i am the anderson
technically correct but why quibble over details
isn't it possible deep down, that you also slept with jfk
who, me
no, i couldn't have, you protest
believe whatever you have to
i am not willing to live that lie any longer
the truth about our camelot obsessed society is each of us in our own way has slept with the jfk
only once we admit this to ourselves individually and as a nation can the true healing begin
a thought to end on tonight
thanks for being with us tonight
stay with cnn
larry king live is next
we are back
it's been a few days since we had any new developments in the laci peterson case
it appears we do have something to talk about this morning
perhaps a search for some new evidence under way
let's check in with our rusty dornin, out in modesto, california, with the latest on that
we knew it was a matter of time before police got back into the water in san francisco bay looking for more evidence in the laci peterson case
that happened this morning
numerous agency r agencies boats with sonar technology and divers into san francisco bay
