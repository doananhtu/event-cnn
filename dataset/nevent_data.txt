Again I apologize for the lack of updates over the past few days and will use this space to recap a weekend that was both good and bad
On Friday a small group of friends and I attended a most-righteous Sister Hazel concert at Floyd's Music Store for the third straight, and for the third straight year I was blown away by one of my favorite live bands
Sister Hazel has a way of becoming intimate with the fans by brining them into the show
It's something you can always expect from these guys, unlike so many other performers, and is why I never miss a show when they're in town
Naturally, I dressed up as Hugh Hefner and took the role of making sure everyone was having a good time
I have yet to hear any complaints from any of the guests
On Saturday the Seminoles were bested by unranked Maryland; effectively ending our chances at a national title this year
In addition, the quarterback controversy has once again debouched as Chris Rix almost took us to victory with his deep threat
Fortunately the agony of defeat was blanketed somewhat by our Halloween party and I won't have to worry about Seminole Football until next Saturday
On Sunday we saw Saw and as expected I was less than satisfied
It was neither better nor worse than last week's The Grudge but the trailers beforehand dictate that the end of this year and the beginning of 2005 will bring us a large quantity of horror movies
If I enjoy one out of five considering the genre I can say it's worth it
I wish I could have been at a Pub, or wherever these people convene, to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this morning (emphasis added)
The Home Office and police chiefs should instead tackle the possession of guns in criminal hands, said Prof Mauser, a member of the independent Fraser Institute in Canada
He has given evidence to select committees of the House of Commons and the Canadian Senate and predicted the escalation of gun crime on Britain's streets
I believe that factors of political correctness are at work, he said
Police crackdowns, Home Office initiatives and over-regulation of legally held weapons create froth and they may even fool the police themselves into believing they are doing something about gun crime
Recorded gun crime rose by three per cent to 10,590 incidents in the year to June 
Two-thirds of gun crime takes place in London, Birmingham and Manchester
It doesn't matter to these people that crime has skyrocketed since the irrational ban on private gun possession went into effect in Great Britain
Just as long as it's there, they feel safe
I can see why he would do it
He was probably running around being shot at for days on end in Falluja
There should be an investigation but they should look into the circumstances, said Lance Corporal Christopher Hanson
Two shots to the head, said Sergeant Nicholas Graham, 24, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
You can't trust these people
He should not be investigated
He did nothing wrong
I've got too many friends in Iraq right now I want to see come home alive and well, and I will support them at every opportunity
I didn't mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore the issue, but I have been extremely busy last week with Thanksgiving and everything that goes along with it
This is problem that needs to be addressed
As this article points out, the SKS wasn't included on the list of banned weapons as part of the 10-year ban on certain assault weapons signed by President Clinton
The SKS is a medium-powered carbine equipped with a 10-round magazine, just like the pistol I'm displaying in the photo on the left hand side of this blog
Banned weapons had capacities of more than 10 rounds; so like my small 9mm, the SKS was not classified as an assault weapon
So let's not center our discussion around the gun, let's talk about the person behind the trigger
Well, we'll debate that later on in the show
We'll have a couple of experts come out, so I'll withhold my comments until then
Now, why has our president placed homeland security in the hands of Republican political hacks instead of professionals, by the way
Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example, is a career politician
Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge is another career politician who was passed over by Mr. Bush for the vice presidency
And Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Asa Hutchinson is yet another career politician and a graduate of the disgraceful Bob Jones University
Apparently, Mr. Bush only turns to professionals when it's really important, like political consulting
And you know what, they did a hell of a job for our country
Our president has put homeland security in the hands of failed Republican hacks
So it's OK -- it's OK to have professional politicians at the Justice
Department and the Pentagon
Janet Reno was a career prosecutor
ust a minute, let me finish my sentence, please
No, the difference is Janet Reno was a career prosecutor
John Ashcroft wasn't half the woman that Janet Reno was
Another potential Democratic presidential candidate pondered whether to run, and he made his announcement, and surprise, surprise, the answer was no
Why not
Surely Chris Dodd is at least more credible than Carol Moseley-Braun or Dennis Kucinich
I guess that means harassing Tom Ridge, fighting tax cuts and obstructing President Bush's plans to reform judiciary. Some two years
God, I hope so
that's all I can say
I love Senator Dodd
He would have brought a lot to the race
He brings a lot to the Senate and to the debate
And I'm glad that he's going to be fighting those fights
Well, the Commerce Department reports today that consumer spending declined in January and that the manufacturing sector slowed in February
Meanwhile, the deficit now at $300 billion
Mr. Bush apparently is untroubled by this fiscal collapse
One of his aides tells the current issue of "TIME," magazine, quote, "even if it's $500 billion, so what
Of course, even a $500 billion deficit number doesn't count the $3 trillion Mr. Bush is robbing from the Social Security trust fund
You know, we should have known, every time George W. Bush gets in trouble, he borrows from a trust fund. It's been his whole life, you know
Let me give you two economic facts of like, which you should know, even if you won't recognize them
Number one, there is absolutely no relationship between the deficit and unemployment
They don't go together
And number two, there is no Social Security fund, Virginia
There just isn't one
Because Bush squandered it on his tax cuts
There never has been one
There has been one for 60 years
Welcome back
Bob, one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this war and so many people around the world don't want to go is there have been a lot of problems with credibility from this administration
Bad move
But while he was here, he gave us a whole lot of information
Gave us a whole lot of information
Well, our president told us that information proves that the dictator had chemical weapons, which is true
But what we just learned this week from Newsweek magazine which got a hold of the debriefings, is that he also told us it was destroyed back in 1995
Why hasn't our president told us that
Why do we have to learn it from Newsweek
I don't believe that he believed it was all destroyed
Good point
But shouldn't our president have told us what the CIA told him
Why do we learn from Newsweek
Should he level with us
Bush isn't sitting in that White House not thinking about the body bags coming home with great young men
I was at the medal of honor ceremony for the kids
I am shook over the aftermath
But, this guy is a monster, a mini-me Hitler
Take a look at it
That's pretty good support isn't it
Now, Bob, come on you don't really buy this
I mean, listen, this is the oldest trick in the book
You can have a general question like this that could mean anything and ask people and they give you what comes off the top of their head
But, ask them another question, ask them what they think about spending $1.3 trillion in destroying this economy
Ask them how they feel about getting bogged down
Well, I've seen some of the figures
Once you start telling Americans the story, -- the administration refuse today tell us story
Tom, you know what liberals want
They don't want a smoking gun, they want a smoking city
The Clinton people all say
Former Congressman, Bob Dornan from California
You're not going to get a smoking city
Time for Fireback, when the viewers fire back at us
Joshua Hosford of Newport Beach, California -- that would be nice in this weathers -- Paul, I guess we're going after all
Case in point, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed
It's amazing how someone can actually do two things at once
Joshua, you couldn't have said anything better
In fact, I've already said it
Well, in fact, our allies got Mr. Mohammed along with us
We need allies
And Bush is so far angered every ally we have
Bush has been torturing Americans for two years. Why should this guy get preferential treatment
And I thought he was -- I thought he was busy running the Redskins
No
OK
The next comment is from Frank Mastro of New York City
Mr.Novak, I don't understand the problem
I say that to all the rich millionaire Democrats, like Carville and Begala, who don't want tax cuts
Pay it anyway
They'll defeat Bush and everybody will get rich
That's a better strategy
David Horn of Long Island, New York, writes, "How can Bush say he's for democracy
Where did he learn to govern, 1930's Chicago
Hi
I'm Paul Avalar from Tempe, Arizona
I had a question also about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed
That's a great question
It's an unanswerable point
He hasn't been able to answer it
And Tom Andrews wasn't able to answer it
Look, we need allies to catch these guys
We got him because the Pakistanis got him
We didn't get him
We go to war in Iraq, 200,000 people start protesting in Pakistan, they put too much pressure on the government
It becomes impossible for those governments to cooperate with us like they're cooperating now
We go to war in Iraq, it would be the worst thing we can do
You know the one thing the Democrats can't stand is good news
It is just something you cannot handle
No
What I can't stand is a president who is going to screw up our war against terrorism when I thought that was his job
From the left, I'm Paul Begala
Good night for CROSSFIRE
From the right, I'm Robert Novak
Join us again next time for another edition of CROSSFIRE
Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
Ironically down in North Carolina today was also the day funeral services were held for 17-year-old Jesica Santillan, the brave young woman who got the wrong heart and lungs in a botched transplant operation last month
Is her family's pain and suffering only worth $250,000
Ralph Nader, there are states in crisis that keep adding to the list by the AMA where doctors are going out of business because they can't afford the medical malpractice rates
We'll just run a scroll of some of the states
They're big states. Florida, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Texas
This is a real crisis that lawyers have perpetrated on America, isn't it
Another one of your leading questions
This is a medical malpractice crisis
And the insurance companies which had relatively steady rates on doctors for about 10 years have found its investment income, its interest income, the stock market collapse down
And so they're jacking up the rates on a few key specialties like obstetricians and neurosurgeons
But if you take the entire amount of premiums, Bob, that's paid by doctrs in this country to malpractice insurers and divide it evenly, they'd be paying less than $9,000 each
That's one-third of what they pay a receptionist
You know, Ralph, you and I often agree on some things and one thing I think we agree on is the dirty effect of money and politics
This is first and foremost, Bob, a question of equity
The Congress is going to handcuff the judges and juries in the United States at the state court level
I haven't yet met one senator or representative who's for this bill who has demonstrated that the jurors in their home state and the judges in their home state are incompetent, unwilling or unable to perform justice in these medical malpractice cases
And I've never heard one person say that the insurance executives who make $250,000 a week, every week without any pain and suffering, no one is saying cap those
Dr. Palmisano, first thank you for being here
Thank you
Pleasure to be here
And, I want to ask you to respond to one of the witnesses, John McCormick testified today
He said that the hospital ignored abnormal CO2 levels in her blood
Said that the attending physician had slept through several pages
Listen to what Mr. McCormick said and I'll ask you to respond
Mr. President, from father to father, my family's pain and suffering are not frivolous
Isn't he right
Isn't our president wrong to be -- did he win the Lottery
You know, Mr. Bush -- President Bush says these guys have won the litigation Lottery
Well, the current medical liability system is affecting patients in that they can't get access to care
The American Medical Association works very hard to make safety a priority in the medical care system
The current system doesn't measure negligence
It measures disability
Another witness today told of what happened to her husband because there were no longer neurosurgeons available in the community
Those are important points, I don't doubt
Yes
Well, what has to be done here is balance
What we need is a system that's fair to everyone, a system that keeps the physicians in practice and allows patients to have access to physicians in their hour of need.
And the system in California that's in the bill, in Congress now, HR-5, that's a system that has worked
Because in California they have regulated the insurance company premium levels
And in Florida, they've been very weak on it
In other words a small percentage of doctors that are bad, incompetent, indifferent, whatever
They're not performing properly and the AMA is not cracking down, is not supporting expansion to state licensing
I want to respond to that
The National Practitioner Data Bank is the source of the information and it was brought up today
First of all, the Government Accounting Office criticized the methodology used
It doesn't mention whether they are obstetricians, neurosurgeons or emergency medicine
It doesn't list that
Now are these bad doctors
We'll have no doctors, we'll have no neurosurgeons, no obstetricians
We've got to take a break
Maybe they are bad doctors
Welcome back
Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reports this week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out of their practices all across the country
President Bush points this way today, even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money, premiums go up and either way, the patient pays
We're debating malpractice reform with consumer advocate Ralph Nader, and AMA President-Elect Dr. Ronald Palmisano
Dr Palmisano, again, thanks for staying with us through the break
He was the governor of my state of Texas, where there are a whole lot of doctors
It turns out that he didn't do any ind of a job policing your profession at all when he was the governor of Texas
It has forgiven physicians who overlook cancerous tumors, who maimed infants or whose mistakes left women sterilized
Thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade
That is the Bush record in policing surgeons, why should we trust him now
Well, first off
Physicians generally, not just surgeons, forgive me
Sure
What we need to do is to make sure that state boards, number one, have adequate funding
The AMA supports that
But it's also
Well, it's also unfair to make a judgment without knowing all of the facts of the case
Troy Brennan of Harvard said there's no correlation with negligence, only with disability
So let's look at all of the facts, but give everybody due process here in America before we criticize
Even file a claim
And the entire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money, not the 90 percent who never file a claim, amounts to less than what we spend on dog food
On dog food
It's about $5.4 billion is the pay-out
That's a fraction of physician income
It's a fraction of the health care expense of 1.4 trillion
What we have to do is look at all the facts and have balance here
That's what the people in Congress have to do
They have to make sure that whatever they decide keeps doctors in practice and patients having access to care
Doctors are going
They don't abandon their patients, except for the high premiums of a few specialties
Because of the premiums
But first of all let me
Why don't you crack down on the insurance companies
No. Let's talk about the facts
Let's talk about the facts
That's the fact
I was just in Oklahoma, they own this insurance company
They are trying to do their very best
It's a company not for profit
What happens here is that more money is being paid out than comes in
And as far as the investment income, A.M
Bests show that in the past five years, the investment income has been stable at around 5 percent
Brown Brothers Harriman said that investments did not precipitate the current crisis
Why do you want that to be secret
All of the information about bad doctors in the National Practitioner bank, you, the AMA wants to keep it secret from other doctors and other patients around the country who want to know whether their doctor is on that list
Let's listen to what he said to the AMA today
They should be able to recover non- economic damages as well
But for the sake of the system, non- economic damages should be capped at $250,000
What in the world is wrong with that
Tell me what's wrong with that
What's wrong
Tell someone who had a double mastectomy, tell an infant who's brain-damaged and has no economic loss that for the rest of their lives they're going to get dribbled out $250,000 for their entire life expectancy
Wait a minute
The head of AIG a few years ago was making $250,000 every week
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money, though
Not for you, but for most people it's a lot of money
These executives, why don't you tell
In California - wait, Mr. Nader. In California
Why don't you cap insurance
Mr. Palmisano, go ahead
Give me a moment, please
Go ahead, go ahead
In California where they have this law, it caps the non-economics, the ones you can't quantify
So all medicals, all rehabilitation, care services in the home, lost wages
No, no, no
I've got to ask Mr. Nader, we are almost out of time
Doug Friedman, who ran Jesse Ventura's campaign for governor four years ago, says he wants you to run for president again
I know you're saying it's much too early to run for president
But one simple question, Ralph, will you consider another run for president
Much too early to consider
I am concerned about Donald Zook, who's head of a medical malpractice insurance company, a big one in the West, saying that his insurance company executive colleagues should not blame the tort injury system
He said that your problem of jacking up these insurance rates is self-inflicted
Here's an insurance company executive who is saying that
Well, Mr. Zook is one executive you are quoting
What we need to do is look at all of the people who don't have doctors
Hey, let's get some agreement
Should we get some agreement
What
Do you want to really crack down on the bad doctors
We want to crack down on the attorneys who file frivolous suits
Fine. Fine
What kind of peer review is that
Wait. Wait
Do you want to crack down on the bad doctors
You're in AMA
We definitely want to crack down on bad doctors
Do you want to control insurance rates
We want the free market to dictate what is done
The free market actually dictates we have got to sell some commercials here on CNN or we're all out of
Thanks. Privilege to be here
Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
Over in Iraq, arms inspectors are discovering and destroying missiles
Spy planes are searching for more banned arms, and Iraqi scientists are being interviewed by U.N. weapons inspectors
Back with us to talk about it, two Congressmen: J.D
Hayworth, the Republican from Arizona, and Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont
But I want to ask you a question
The answer is, these are my neighbors from Vermont and obviously we're going to support them
But let's be clear
The president almost unilaterally is putting us in this position against world opinion
Didn't the Congress support it
I thought you voted for it
I did not vote for it
I mean the Congress
The majority rules
Yes. The Congress gave him authority, but the American people disagreed with the decision
Not according to the polls
Not the polls that I have seen
Congressman Hayworth, back to a comment
And I know that you meant it and I agreed with it
This is Saddam Hussein, the butcher of Baghdad
I'm curious, would that have accurately described him in 1988
Oh, yes. I think it does
I think it has described him, especially since he's taken basically a one-man rule over with the Baath Party in 1979
I agree
Therefore, wasn't Dick Cheney, as the CEO of Halliburton, wrong to be selling oilfield equipment to the butcher of Baghdad in 1988
I don't know about any oil equipment going to Saddam Hussein
What I do know in the here and now is
I can tell you about it if you like
That's fine
And I know you'd love to cloud the issue
That's an important issue to me
Dissent is fine, but these cheap shots, I don't know anything about Halliburton.
He had $73 million worth of (UNINTELLIGIBLE) to sell oilfield equipment to Saddam Hussei
And to somehow try to play partisan parlor games may be cute, but we are dealing with a clear and present danger
Would you have treated him as a customer, the way Dick Cheney did
I don't even know about that
Would you have sold oilfield equipment to him
Yes. Hello
Iran had hostages
Seventy-nine Americans were held hostage
Hello
We're talking
The United States of America
Oh the evil United States
But the point is
I want to get to that point
I can't quite figure that out
Everybody knows that
The CIA did that
No, the point I made, Khomeini came about because we put a brutal dictator, the Shah of Iran, in power
The point that I am making is you cannot
The point you're making is blame America first\
No I'm not
That's what you're doing
You're talking about blowback
We know what happens
Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, thank you very much
Congressman J.D. Hayworth, a Republican from Arizona, thank you both very much
We will come back to this debate, believe me
One of our viewers, though, thinks there's a sure fire way to get that al Qaeda ring leader to talk
We'll let him fire back in a little bit
But next, out of all of the pictures from this weekend's nail biter between J.D. Hayworth's alma mater of state, and
Bob Novak's beloved University of Maryland, only one photo is dramatic enough or politically charged enough to be the CROSSFIRE Picture of the Day
You do not want to miss this
Hi. I'm Christa Demore from Monrovia, Maryland
And it also proves you can even chew gum and walk at the same time
Doesn't it show that
He cannot eat a pretzel and watch a football became at the same time
So I'm still doubtful of -- no, here's why
This is a serious point and you deserve a serious answer
We now have a foreign policy in Iraq that is putting enormous strain on those allies
We're not severing it -- question
Hi. I'm Ben Charlton from East Lansing, Michigan
I was -- if we wait for U.N. approval for action in Iraq, don't we sacrifice some of our national sovereignty
Well, where are all of the conservative questions
We never have conservatives in the audience
There's no question
I think even Paul would agree with me
It's not a United Nations question
That is correct
The president has got all of the legal authorities he needs
I just pray to god he doesn't use it
We need to go to the U.N. because we want to build coalitions so we have support around the world and so that we don't have to carry the burden ourselves
But legally he has no obligation to go back to the U.N
From the left I am Paul Begala
Goodnight for CROSSFIRE
From the right, I'm Robert Novak
Join us next time for another edition of CROSSFIRE
Hello, everybody
Welcome to CROSSFIRE
We will debate all of that as well as Vanity Fair's latest, stunning revelations about Michael Jackson
Believe it or not, we got new news on Michael Jackson
Do you think he really looks like a mummy
Certainly not a daddy
But first, our own little moonwalk across the political landscape, the CROSSFIRE Political Alert
The foreign ministers of France, Germany and Russia today issued a joint declaration that they will not allow a second American-backed resolution to pass the United Nations Security Council
President Bush is said to be focusing on one fence-sitting Security Council member, the African nation of Guinea, because he said -- quote -- I used to have one of their pigs
So -- OK, I made that up
He didn't say that
Well, I suspected that
You know
But they are a swing vote
Guinea is an important swing vote
As is Cameroon
France and Germany are pointing to inspection and saying, Look, they're working
I think that's a good point
Well, France and Germany would like to
Powell called Iraqi steps toward disarmament -- quote -- too little, too late gestures, meant to split international resolve to force Baghdad to give up its weapons of mass destruction
U.S
intelligence said Powell indicates Iraq has hidden equipment to produce al-Samoud 2 missiles, even as it destroys existing ones, missiles that until recently, it claimed not to have
Powell also revealed that Iraq is hiding chemical and biological weapons in poor neighborhoods around Baghdad
In order to secure peace, Powell concluded, the international community must confront Saddam Hussein's refusal to disarm -- quote -- here and now
So, there you have it
who do you believe
Secretary of State Colin Powell or France
No, the question is
That is the question
Who do you believe: the Bush administration or your lying eyes
We are watching them destroy weapons, as the president says, Oh, that's just a hoax
But Paul
They are disarming
No, no, no that's not what the president's saying
He's saying, the -- it's a hoax to the extent that those are only a small number of the weapons there
Keep in mind, these are weapons that Saddam Hussein, until recently, said he didn't even have
He's a liar
Of course
And to trust Saddam Hussein in effort to disarm him -- foolish task,don't you think
Absolutely. Nobody trusts Saddam Hussein. 
The question is, Is he a sufficient threat to America today to risk the lives of our young men and women
That's a separate question
That's a very separate question
I think he's not
I think the inspections can work
That's a different argument
We can take it up later
So there it is, according to NBC
In fact, the only liberal with the solo cable talk show
NBC, of course, is a division of the conglomerate GE, where they apparently only bring right wing things to life
I actually like Phil Donahue
I've interviewed him a number of times
His arguments are really dumb
I don't know if you've listened to Phil Donahue
Delightful guy, but his arguments don't make a lot of sense and I think that is the problem with liberal talk show hosts -- you excluded, of course, and James
But the arguments, actually, don't hold up very well
Have you noticed that
He had the highest-rated show on the network
Which is saying what
They're good to me
They're very nice people and they're very good to me
OK, OK, I'm not beat up on MSNBC
Early reviews have not been good, so yesterday she announced she'll be making some changes
Not to her ideas, which are few
Not to her record, which is pretty embarrassing
Not even to her staff, which is, of course, tiny
But to her name
From here on out, Carol Moseley-Braun as Carol Moseley Braun
Did you catch the difference
In the second version, there is no hyphen between her last names
Moseley Braun expects that primary voters in Iowa and New Hampshire will react enthusiastically to this radical, grammatical transformation
They'll have to, because the latest CNN poll shows Moseley Braun far behind the candidate she set out to discredit
That would be, of course, the honorable Al Sharpton
Sharpton is not only by far the first choice of black voters nationally, he is tied with Senator John Edwards among all voters and beating Governor Howard Dean, Representative Dennis Kucinich and Senator Bob Graham
Beating them
And Al Sharpton didn't even have to change his name
How did he become honorable
Yes!
By embodying the values of your party
Your values, not mine
He's the No. 1 pick, the most popular, among all candidates, among black primary voters
I mean, you can't dismiss him. He's a serious candidate
We haven't even begun the primaries
He's not a serious candidate
He's right wing fantasy and it's never going to happen
Not right wing
Take Al Sharpton seriously, that's our message tonight
Then, can you spell prosthetic nose
Maureen Orth can, and she does in a new Vanity Fair profile of Michael Jackson
We'll talk to her
You won't want to miss that
We'll be right back
Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
France, Russia and Germany today restated their opposition to any new U.N. Security Council that could threaten Saddam Hussein's grip on power
Secretary of State Colin Powell goes to the U.N. tomorrow to do what he can
Mr.King, thanks for stying with us through the break
And you're a congressman who has put his constituents and his country ahead of his partisan interests
So I wonder if you'll join Charlie Rangel, who put out a press release today, decrying the Republican attempt to hijack a bill to help our servicemen to use it to give special interest tax breaks to corporations
The important thing is that the bill pass for the military
If the other stuff's in there, it's there
I mean to me, the main purpose should be the military
I'm not going to disagree with Charlie's point
On the other hand, often when bills are passed, there are things attached to them
So to me, the key thing is that we ought to be taking care of the military and that's what we should do
A lot of Democrats said similar things
This weekend Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the No. 2 member of al Qaeda and another significant al Qaeda member were captured in Rawalpindi, Pakistan
Doesn't it turn out that Mr.Daschle and others didn't know what they were talking about and maybe they shouldn't make charges like that in public when they don't know what they were talking about
You would agree with that, wouldn't you
Why was he No. 3
Why wasn't he No. 4
Well, I don't know
I think that puts you pretty high up in the organization
I haven't the slightest clue who this guy was
I haven't heard anybody suggest that he's not one of the central figures in al Qaeda
Have you
But I think the main thing that we have now is we should concentrate on Osama bin Laden, we should concentrate on dismantling Saddam Hussein
A defenseless nation
They have biological weapons
How are they defenseless
Listen, if this is
It was our fault that they have biological and chemical weapons
Come on
Let me tell you
We have a lot of people
that have dangerous weapons
What happens if the North Koreans take another look
Our country is great enough and strong enough to maintain the moral authority to convince the international community that we're right
I'm sorry to have to do this, but we are out of time
I want have Congressman Peter King from New York back on, and Congressman Charlie Rangel
Thank you both for a very interesting debate
In a minute we will look at His Holiness, John Paul II's efforts to be a peacemaker
Later, the author of "Vanity Fair's" scary new look at the King of Pop, Michael Jackson
You will not want to miss this
Stay with us
Welcome back to CROSSFIRE
Maybe it's just me, but I think Michael Jackson, he's kooky, wacky
I recall, as reported in 'The Wall Street Journal,' that the transactions were legal
Is it possible that the equipment allowed Iraq to produce oil for the Oil for Food program authorized by the U.N.
They were legal because Mr.Cheney's company used a loophole
They went through a foreign subsidiary
But they did enrich Saddam Hussein and his evil, ruthless regime, and they were immoral
They were wrong
Dick Cheney should have never profited off of doing business with Saddam Hussein
I would agree with that
It means Cheney is a hypocrite
Well it's a complete
That's great
Well yesterday he was a valued customer, today he's an even villain
Right. So we're against Dick Cheney, but that doesn't have anything to do with Saddam Hussein
It must be the humanitarian reasons
Well, Chad, that's what liberals assume
It is a weird assumption, don't you think
As you know, I've never said that
You haven't
It's called democracy
Those leaders are reflecting the views of their people
They hate America, Paul
My name is Christina Wright
I'm from Minneapolis, Minnesota
It might
I mean that's absolutely one of the fears
That it would destabilize the entire region
So the question is, could it be worse
Our president believes it will set off a positive domino effect of democracy through the region
Maybe he's right
I don't think he's thought it through
I think it's more likely that this very unstable region could cause even more problem
Oh, come on
That's silly
Hi. I'm Fabian from Bonn, Germany
It's actually Western Europe, because 18 European countries are on the side of the United States. So France and Germany -- that's actually true -- find themselves in the minority on their own continent
And good
Only Great Britain is with us
The only country
What do you mean only Great Britain
My question is not who votes at the U.N.
Nobody except Great Britain
We are isolated
From the left, I am Paul Begala
Goodnight for CROSSFIRE
From the right, I'm Tucker Carlson
Join us again tomorrow night for yet more CROSSFIRE
Their military service goes back to the Vietnam era
Others, though, are novices
They are, we are told, well trained
This is a messy business
In the spring of 1970, a squad of U.S. soldiers spotted a small unit of Viet Cong that had been circling for days
And what's that like
That's one of those introspective times where it's just -- it's just an introspective time, not a public time
After his first, he returned to a ship deck full of sailors and crew cheering, shaking his hand, pushing in to slap his back
And one of the guys looked at me and says
And, all of a sudden, bang, it just hit me
You don't think about those things
And it's removed
It's far off
It's not in close
Of all the wounds time does not heal, the ones that fester deep in the soul are the wounds you inflict
It's not something that civilized people do
You don't -- it's just not -- it's not a matter of being tormented, but troubled in the sense that that's not what we do, unless we're called upon to do it, under the most extreme set of circumstance
Training bridges that gap
So your choices are not varied
It's very simple
And so you do what you're trained to do
You do what you're there to do
And, in Vietnam, it was body count
It's hard to explain what training can do
Training sets your mind to respond not to common sense and judgment, but to training
You really don't have time to think: I'm going the wrong way
I should be going the other way
He won a Bronze Star
Nobody is looking for medals
Everyone wants to live another day
Don't misunderstand
Maybe that's a good thing
Candy Crowley, CNN, Washington
Remarkable interviews and a reminder that what these men and women are going through right now in Iraq, they will remember for the rest of their lives
That's our coverage this hour
Who looks out for the unlikely prospect of Iraqi aircraft, and the more likely prospect of Iraqi missiles or artillery
Does your mindset change across the border into Iraq
No, because I am in an area which I don't know where the enemy could be and I might get to the airplane, by the time I get out of the airplane I'm thinking the same way
The hair on the back of my neck starts standing up, then something's going wrong
As a precaution, the crew starts turning the huge plane in circles to see what the targets do
Ultimately it's discovered the targets are U.S. combat helicopters
Minutes later the search and rescue helicopter arrives for its refueling
Watch the flash from our night vision camera as the plane's fuel line connects with the chopper
Both aircraft fly at 125 miles per hour gingerly over enemy land
At times they are only 50 feet apart with the chopper's rotor blades getting closer
Looking with the naked eye out of the plane, the helicopter is impossible to see
The pitch-black maneuver ends after 10 minutes
Again, we know where we're going
We all fly with bulletproof vests in case the plane goes down
We also fly with parachutes in case we need to get out before the plane goes down
But three airmen aboard this plane have parachutes for a different reason
They are the Pararescue jumpers, or PJs who jump off the plane for rescue missions
I mean it's probably the most - the best feeling in the world knowing that your purpose is really defined at that moment
No rescues were necessary on this sortie
Do you have any fear
Everybody has a little bit of fear but I think it's a good thing in this circumstance
This crew could be back on another mission in as few as 24 hours
This is a very busy base
We want to give you a look right now at the aircraft coming in for landings
It looks like LAX on a Sunday night and this is what it's been like for the past 11 days
We have just watched multitudes of warplanes land, multitudes of warplanes take off and this may be the busiest night of the campaign
Wolf, back to you
That's a lot of bombs and missiles
Gary Tuchman in an air base near the Iraq border, thanks very much, Gary Tuchman
General Richard Myers will be my special guest on a special late addition
That's at noon Eastern, nine A.M
Pacific tomorrow
That's Sunday and I'll be back Judy and at the top of the hour for Wolf Blitzer Reports
We'll have a complete wrap of all the day's late breaking developments
In the meantime, back to Judy Woodruff in Washington
We'll be watching you both times at the top of the hour and certainly for late edition on Sunday
Thanks Wolf
Greg Milam is with the U.K. forces in southern Iraq
Seemingly deserted, these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to British forces in Iraq
This is what we're coming across a lot of these, 30 mil, 60 mil, 80 mil, even 120 mil
So there's plenty still out there that will have to be recovered because they can be used
Do you know when this place was last used
I mean do you know
I'm not too sure but judging by some of this, it's been here quite a long time so whether it's been used recently by them - there was an Intel upbeat saying that they were possibly coming back to try and get this to use against them
Grenades, mortars, all sorts of ammunition abandoned by Iraqi soldiers but there for the taking
The job of these Royal Engineers is to clear this and many other mountains of armaments and destroy them
Some are too unstable to be moved and have to be blown up on the spot
The rest is carried way out into the desert
With the coalition forces moving forward the last thing they want is weaponry like this lurking behind them
With the amounts of ammunition and weapons left about, if they'd used those systems, that amount of weapon it would have given us a considerable amount of trouble trying to take the positions
With much of this weaponry there is only one safe thing to do
No one in the British forces here is willing to take any risks
Greg Milam, Sky News, Southern Iraq
That's something to look at
CNN's Chris Plante is chasing all that down for us at the Pentagon right now
Hello Chris
Hi, Judy
That's right
So it won't change our overall rules of engagement
It doesn't effect the operation at large but to protect our soldiers it clearly requires great care
So certainly an unpleasant development today Judy and another item on the docket over here today is the failure of a number of cruise missiles
Tomahawk land detect missiles being from launched from ships in the eastern Mediterranean and in the Red Sea have suffered a number of failures
The Pentagon says a total of seven of the cruise missiles have failed crashing in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia
The missiles are programmed so that they don't detonate until they reach their target
If they go astray, then the warheads never arm but claiming that it's about one percent of the warheads
They've fired 675 or so tomahawk land detect missiles from ships and seven of those have failed
Chris, very quickly, new information from the Pentagon today about any concerns they have about Saddam Hussein's ongoing air defense capability
Well, no major concern
The reason that they're still in tact according to today's briefing was that they had not turned them on and as long as they don't turn them on, the U.S. has trouble locating them
All right
We're paying attention to all those details for us, Chris Plante at the Pentagon
Coming up, coalition forces control several parts of southern Iraq but they still face some serious problems including pockets of resistance
That story when we come back
A serious problem they still face though, pockets of resistance
Reporter David Bowden is with the British forces in Umm Qasr in southern Iraq
It's not pretty and there's no please and thank you but for the Marines, every door potentially hides a gunman and when your life is on the line, manners go out the window
This patrol did find hidden weapons
They're not the first and they're unlikely to be the last
The Marines believe they have a firm hold on Umm Qasr right now but they can't afford to slack in their grip and allow those who are hostile to the coalition forces to regroup and begin again their cycle of violence
The Marines with their snipers have now snipers have now spread their area of operations north to include the town of Umm Kiou
As in Umm Qasr before it, they're here to clear out the opponents to regime change
It was a painful and bloody mistake
We've now evacuated them out and the enemy now have either fled or they've been captured
The Royal Marines are satisfied they are in control of this small corner of Iraq
Their task now is to keep it that way. David Bowden in southern Iraq
That report filed just a short time ago
Well, CNN analyst Ken Pollack who is with the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution is with me now
He is an expert on the Iraqi military and its tactics and weapons
Right
I mean we're seeing one of the great advantages of U.S. and British forces now, Judy, which is that they're superbly trained troops
They have training in a whole variety of different missions and they're adapting
They recognize now they went in with some false assumptions about the kind of reception that they were going to face
The plan that was implemented had some inherent risks in it, risks to the supply line, risks in terms of not clearing cities and they're shifting
They're changing and the troops are trained well enough to be able to deal with that
You've seen U.S. Central Command bringing up additional forces like the 82nd Airborne Division to better deal with these long supply lines, get control over the cities and so I think that U.S. and British forces are beginning to stabilize the battlefield
So as an onlooker, as somebody who's studied the Iraqi capabilities, is it your sense that the coalition can continue to adjust to whatever they deal with
Absolutely
One of the things I think we're likely to see is that the Iraqis are going to have a tougher time adapting than U.S
forces are
Typically what you've seen in the Iraqi armed forces is the change has to come from the top
It doesn't come from the ground up
You don't have ground commanders calling back and saying hey, we'd like to try this tactic or this seems to work
Tell everybody else to do the same thing
Instead the high command has to identify a problem, come up with a solution and transmit it down
There's no way around that but U.S. forces, British forces are beginning to adapt to it
I want to ask you about you mentioned coalition forces going in expecting more support from ordinary Iraqi people
I just interviewed a gentleman, native of Iraq, who talks to his family there all the time and he says they live in Baghdad 20, 30, 50 of them and he said they do the view the Americans as invaders
They hate Saddam Hussein
They don't like what he's doing but they don't think the Americans are the answer
All right
They remember that the United States betrayed them in 1991
The U.S. didn't finish Saddam then
President Bush - then President Bush called on them to rise up and then the U.S. did nothing and so they're deeply suspicious of what we have in mind
Which raises questions going forward
What's the significance of that
Well, if it's true and obviously we don't know just yet but if it's true, it is very significant because it's effectively the
Chances are it was an Iraqi surface to air missile
We're going to go quickly to northern Iraq now where we find CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman
There's been some action in that area
Nick - I mean - I'm sorry
Ben, we can make you out just barely but tell us what you've been seeing
Yes
Not just Iraqi positions behind us, in addition to that in the direction of Mosul as well which is a major northern Iraqi city about 28 miles to the west of me
Ben, what is your best understanding of what it is on the ground that the coalition forces are going after the
They have mortars
They have anti-tank guns, hundreds of men along this very long ridge that basically runs from the north to the south
Ben, very - we thank you very much for that and we'll be coming back to you as the night - as the night wears on
We're getting close to the bottom of the hour
We're going to get some headlines at the hour right now with Heidi Collins
I hope they get a little rest
Slowly humanitarian aid is rolling into southern Iraq but dramatic scenes like this one of a crowd tearing into the supplies on a convoy truck only underscores how desperate the need is
Correspondent Martin Geissler files this report from the Iraqi town of Safwan
Now they are desperate
Within seconds the Kuwaiti aid workers who had organized this trip were overpowered by the mob
These desperate scenes are exactly what the aide agencies wanted to avoid
This is survival of the fittest
Only the healthy and strong can get to the food
The weak and the ill are left with nothing
Despite this effort to help the Iraqi people, resentment is never far away
We hate U.S. We hate British, England
What do you think about Saddam's regime
Saddam's very good man
As the supplies ran out the mood swung from frantic to uglyf
We, as a consequence, have had to move out
It's simply too dangerous
This is a clear indication that despite the coalition reassurances that this part of Iraq is safe and despite the aid being brought into the people here, it is still a very, very volatile area
Tonight here the strong are eating
The weak still go hungry
Martin Geissler, ITV News, Safwan southern Iraq
So many different pictures we are getting from across that country
Well, they are making their voices heard at home and abroad
Congresswoman Maxine Waters was among those scheduled to attend
CNN's Rusty Dornin is with us from San Francisco
I'm getting various estimates on the crowd
We did want to show you an interesting thing here
Some folks are showing some solidarity with the speakers here
You're looking at some of San Francisco's police department's officers
I did ask them why they did that
They said they were wearing skullcaps so they decided to adopt this to show solidarity
They said the department has not made any statement about whether they think that's all right or not
So far, very peaceful
As I said, there have been a few verbal exchanges but one of the most enthusiastically received speakers here was Bessam Al-Husaini, an Iraqi American
He's with the Iraqi American Council
How do you feel about supporting the troops
And to the south, British forces continue their attack on targets around Basra
ITN correspondent Tim Ewart reports
They are facing Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard, his finest soldiers
But for all the resistance, coalition aircraft rule the skies and coalition technology is overwhelmingly superior
U.S
commanders believe the Republican Guard is a doomed force
How does the Iraqi American Council feel
Well the Iraqi American have been waiting for this liberation and they want to get rid of Saddam so bad and they will have to take it the way it's been offered to us
He would love to see this and would draw on this emotion from the Arab world and the European country
Now you said you did talk to your family in Baghdad as well and they also are somewhat suspicious of the Americans
Well, I mean the Iraqi people have been the primary victim from the whole thing
Yeah my family, you know, still in fear
You know they stay in one room
They boarded all the - all the windows and they built with a brick one of the windows facing the street
I mean yes, you know, my prayer to them but we can only do so much
We can live in liberty and freedom soon
Now I understand some of the people here have been threatened by anti-war protesters
Have you had anyone either threatening you or
No, no problem
OK
Thank you very much
Thank you
It is wrapping up this afternoon and it looks like the civil disobedience acts by the anti-protesters are scheduled to get underway once again next week
The situation here appears to be increasingly tense
A few moments ago, out on the horizon, not very far ahead of the U.S. Army's 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, we heard more than a few explosions
The U.S. Army's 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry has compiled a rather extraordinary record in the past several days
It was the Army which assigned me to the 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, and that was extremely fortuitous
It was like sitting in a poker game and drawing four aces, because this is a crack unit
It's the tip of the tip of the spear
We just heard an incoming -- what the hell
No, no, I don't know what it is
Recall Winston Churchill's old quote, There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at and missed
What you try to do is stay calm and continue your broadcasting
The worst thing you can do, either as a soldier or as a war correspondent is panic
We're hearing incoming
We're not sure what it is
We see some stuff in the sky
We may have to break this off
I think we're going to break off this live shot for the time being
We're not sure what we see up there
Goodbye
We've got to dive for vehicles, we think
See you
Bye
We'd like to now show you what we call Old Betsy, a re-used, secondhand U.S. Army Humvee that we've been traveling with
Any bullet will pass through it, even a .22 caliber bullet
You can see our body armor draped on the door
This is what we've literally been living in
This is the kitchen, when we're down, and we're very fortunate, because we've got a teapot
That's my cubby hole
It's extraordinary cramped, because (UNINTELLIGIBLE) sandbag the floor, in case we hit a mine
That's all the space I have to eat and sleep in
You don't sleep
You really don't sleep out here
You have to realize, they've been riding along, bouncing along in these tanks for probably six or more hours now
And if you ride inside that tank, it is like riding in the bowels of a dragon
They roar, they screech
The hardest part of the trip is personal discomfort
We cannot tell you the levels of personal discomfort we've experienced
The extraordinary sandstorms, the bitter cold nights
The most uncomfortable thing is having to sleep sitting up in a Humvee with sandbags under your feet, your knees at your chin
That's excruciatingly uncomfortable, not something that you would wish on anybody but a contortionist
Let me give you an example of what the dust like
Look at this
We have been through days of dust like that
Actually, they're very close, that is to say, no more than 40 yards away, but the dust and sand are blowing so badly you're getting these vague images
It's like being in a blizzard, except unfortunately, the sand doesn't melt as the snow does
What we eat is what the Army calls MREs, meals ready to eat
And I must say, they're pretty darn good
And of course, everybody fights for the best ones
The treats are things like the M&amp;Ms and the breakfast toasties
Let me hold the camera and show you my crew
On camera left is Charlie Miller, he's been our superb and intrepid cameraman
On my right is Jeff Barweis, a brilliant satellite engineer
That's the crew which really brings you these pictures
The pictures you're seeing are absolutely phenomenal
These are live pictures of the 7th Cavalry racing across the desert
You've never seen battlefield pictures like these before
A report from CNN's Kelly Wallace when we return
Many Israelis were fearing that quiet would come to an end
And it did on this day
We can show you some pictures from earlier Sunday
People here tell us the cafe was filled with people enjoying the spring weather
Then it was big bomb
And many soldier
Two soldiers were down here
Many blood
Many people skip from here
Big paranoia
I'm Kelly Wallace, CNN, reporting from Netanyahu, Israel
A baseball legend rallies the troops
Up next, pitching great Roger Clemens talks about his experiences meeting U.S. service members in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf
Hi, Judy
Thank you very much
As of an hour or so ago, we got word from the battlefield that U.S. forces were just 15 miles away from the southern edge of Baghdad
And they may be even closer right now
The Pentagon says two of the Republican Guard divisions defending Baghdad are no longer credible forces
Scenes from Najaf may also be bolstering the troops' spirit
Iraqis who initially were cautious when U.S. forces arrived in Najaf ended cheering them on, shaking their hands and patting their backs
Indeed, all the arrows on the Army's map seem to be pointing in the direction of the southern suburbs of Baghdad
And then the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division secured the town of Karbala
Yesterday we were about 50 miles from the southern suburbs of Baghdad
We have perhaps have that distance
Walter Rodgers, CNN, with the U.S. 7th Cavalry in the Iraqi desert
And it's a similar story from CNN's Karl Penhaul who is now just miles from the southern outskirts of the Iraqi capital
He's embedded with the U.S. Army's 11th Attack Helicopter Regiment
Here's his report just filed a few minutes ago
In fact, it's going much faster than many of the U.S. commanders on the ground predicted
The armor, and mechanized infantry, and artillery pieces and personnel on the ground are moving at rapid speeds
Let's get an update now on casualties on Operation Iraqi Freedom
U.S. Central Command says 4,500 Iraqis have been taken prisoner
One less than yesterday after that dramatic rescue of Private First Class Jessica Lynch
That's all coming up on our special edition of WOLF BLITZER REPORTS at the top of the hour
Judy, back to you
All right, Wolf, and we will be watching
Thanks very much
Well, at the Pentagon briefing this afternoon, officials describing several units of the Republican Guard as effectively no longer being a credible fighting force
Our Jamie McIntyre our senior military affairs correspondent is with us now
Hello, again, Jamie
Well Judy, the Pentagon is beginning to see positive signs that it hadn't seen for awhile
First of all, as we saw just a few moments ago on CNN, the pictures of some of the actual happy Iraqi citizens welcoming U.S. troops, that taking place in Najaf
They met lighter than expected resistance
They may just suddenly be effective on the ground
We believe they have the capability now
At the U.S. Central Command briefing this morning at the forward headquarters in Doha, Qatar, General Vincent Brooks said that the U.S. would be continuing to approach Baghdad
Is there a chance that coalition forces could, at this point, be overestimating the strength of what's left of the opposition
Well, they might be
And that might be a good thing
They are taking it very cautiously
No one, again, they stress the most dangerous part of this could be ahead
Could involve chemical weapons
Could be a very dangerous time
We notice they said they did not want to use the word destroyed, in fact, they said let others do that
Jamie McIntyre at the Pentagon
For a look at what might lie ahead for U.S. forces, let's turn to our Miles O'Brien in Atlanta
Thank you very much, Judy
To help guide us through all this discussion about red zones, and daggers and exactly what is the strength of the Republican Guard, we turn to Colonel Patrick Lang
He spent some time in the Defence Intelligence Agency, among other things
Colonel, good to have you with us
What do you suppose right now would be the governor on the forward advance
Is it the Republican Guard or is it the U.S. and coalition supply lines
Or both
You're welcome
Well, they are close enough up to Baghdad now so that the supply line issue is probably not a big one since they had time to restock, food, fuel and ammunition
So, probably the main thing is combing through the rubble that the air force has left of these Republican Guard divisions to make sure there are no strong points that you leave behind, that could threaten your lines of supply once they get past
Once they are satisfied they are through all that, I would imaging there will be a pause while they start to reconnoiter into Baghdad, probing hard to see how much resistance there really is
Well, let me ask you that
First of all, I just wanted to tell viewers where we just took our satellite imagery
This is that Karbala area which is about 50 miles from Baghdad
Baghdad is roughly in that direction from there
We know the vanguard is supposedly as close as 15 miles
One of the next key points along the way here is Saddam international airport
Do you suppose that is a key target right now
Oh, I'm sure it is
I mean a feature of that importance would always be something you'd want to hold
And if the front stabilizes between there and the downtown Baghdad, they'll start using it for a fixed wing aircraft as well
Control of these highways will be crucial won't it
Yeah, these are the high-speed approaches into the heart of the city and armored forces like the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division just love high-speed approaches
They will try to go down those things, cutting the city up into sectors as best they can, and then work on the specific sectors of the city they think are a key terrain
It's a big city, about the size of Philadelphia or thereabouts
Some have said Chicago is a good analogy
Tremendous amount of force needed to control a city of that source, or am a wrong
Well, it depends on the attitude of the populous, which is not clear yet
If the population, in fact, or at least a big part of them like the Shia half of the population, if they want to be liberated, then you can control them with a fairly small force
If, in fact, a lot of people in the city don't want to be liberated and you're never going to know that until you try, then you're going to need a much larger force, and we might end up waiting a couple of weeks for reinforcements
Based on what you've seen so far, what is your sense of that
They rose up, didn't get American support
Do you suppose it will be a different story in Baghdad
Is there a lot of latent hatred for Saddam Hussein that will come out
Yes, there is, but these folks are going to be mighty cautious
They have a long history of being kicked around by the Sunni Arab population of central Iraq
And they don't have any particular reason to trust us, so far
So they'll wait and see what happens
It's the other people in the city you have to worry about, who are ethnically much the same as the Saddam Hussein regime
And their behavior right now is unpredictable
Always helps Miles to hear a voice of experience
Thank you and thanks to Colonel Lang
When we come back, hopes rising among investors
We're going to check in with Rhonda Schaffler at the stock exchange in just a moment
As coalition forces push ahead in their march toward Baghdad, they have encountered some resistance in the Shiite holy city of Karbala
But American troops and their superior technology have turned out to be a key factor in the fighting there
ITN correspondent Tim Ewart reports
These are soldiers of the U.S. 3rd Infantry, fighting near Karbala, southwest of Baghdad
They are facing Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard, his finest soldiers
But for all the resistance, coalition aircraft rule the skies and coalition technology is overwhelmingly superior
U.S. commanders believe the Republican Guard is a doomed force
We will approach Baghdad
The dagger is clearly pointed at the heart of the regime right now and will remain pointed at it until the regime is gone
To the south, more black smoke over the town of Basra
Tim Ewart, ITV News, southern Iraq
CNN's Brent Sadler is there
A back road leading to Kirkuk, the heartland of northern Iraq's oil wealth
A road that's now in the hands of Iraqi Kurdish forces
Occupying these positions, strattled along a crescent-shaped front line east of Kirkuk
This is the end of the road for Kurdish forces manning this remote checkpoint
But with special permission, they let us through
This territory is within easy artillery range of Saddam Hussein's forces and circling Kirkuk
The oil capital of northern Iraq is visible behind me, just over there, a harmless flare of burning gases is easily identifiable
Iraq's precious oil field remain intact
Also intact, Kirkuk's defenses, in the distant haze
Iraq's armed opposition, including these Kurds, waits on the sidelines to join the fray, if America asks
This is about freedom for Iraq
This is about the liberation of Iraq, and we Iraqis must shoulder the responsibility of helping in the process of liberation
Brent Sadler, CNN, near Kirkuk in northern Iraq
Let's check in with CNN's Gary Tuchman at an air base near Iraq
Gary you've seen it firsthand from the first moments
Well, that's right, Judy
We come to you from a base near the Iraqi border
Many pilots are flying these A-10 attack planes behind me
They also fly F-16s
There are also Marine FA-18s and Marine Heriers at this base
And we spent part of the day at that base
This is Talil, Iraq
The Talil Air Base
It's now a major staging point
You know you are in Iraq when you drive down the road coming into the base and see the portrait of Saddam Hussein
You can see the main one here on the bottom and also here messages like, we won, April 1, 2003
Want to give you a look
There's a lot of security personnel here
You can look over there and you can see the military vehicles
These are Air Force Security Forces with their rifles patrolling the entrance
We're near the town of Nasiriya
But this base now is considered secure enough to make it a major staging point for the coalition
A short time ago we talked to a pilot at this base who has been to that Iraqi base and he too says he has signed that mural right on Saddam Hussein's sash
And we attrit the Medina forces down to less than 50 percent
Lieutenant Colonel Webb is telling us he has a mission this very evening
A total over the last two weeks now of close to 24,000 sorties
Before we go, one more thing we want to tell you about, superstitions
Military people are very superstitious, like many of us are
Here at this particular base they get their MREs, their MREs are their Meals Ready to Eat
They come in a bag
And when you get an MRE you get your meal and you get a little treat with it
What a lot of people here at this base do, when their treat happens to be this one, this is the candy called Charms, many of the people refuse to eat their Charms
They consider it a good luck charm to keep their Charms in their clothes and not to eat them
So one little superstitious tale for you, Judy
Back to you
Well, I'm one of those who thinks that we need to pay attention to our superstitions
Gary, one another quick question for you
Are you able to say, are they actually using it or getting much use out of it
They also fly these HH-60 helicopters, they're the search and rescue helicopters used in case they have to search and find somebody on the ground
They stage there and refuel
But right now, none of them are permanently based there, although the plan is for that to eventually happen
All right, Gary Tuchman with some Charms
You saw him holding it
I will be talking with a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Joe Biden, just ahead, for his take on how the war is going
